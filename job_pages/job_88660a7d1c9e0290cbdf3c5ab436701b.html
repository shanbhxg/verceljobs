            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Seeking software developer for web-controlled brain-slicing robots:You will direct the acquisition of tera-voxels per day of imagery data for science and profit. You must have a strong background in thick-client web development, and you must not be afraid of getting your hands dirty interfacing with robotics hardware and distributed computing. We’re less concerned with the individual skills or experience that you possess, and more interested in your ability to learn quickly and manage heterogeneous codebases like ours. We’re transitioning some developers over to the analysis software stack, so you will be taking over the development of the acquisition stack, with about three other developers contributing some of their time to this project with you. The system you’ll be in charge of:Meteor servers provide the control interfaces for the microscopes, as well as a google-maps-style viewer for the resulting imagery. The robots themselves and our local processing and storage cluster all run Python 3. The local machines pass the data around using zero MQ as they do some inline processing, then store it in a series of RAID arrays, which we use as a local cache that we continuously upload to Amazon S3<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• </p>
