            <p id="jobDescription">About the job Vicara – Job Description Senior Firmware EngineerJob Brief We are looking for an analytical, results-driven Firmware Engineer. You would also be required to have a keen eye for developing firmware with a low memory footprint and low power consumption while being robust and resistant to errors. You are expected to achieve these goals using your in-depth understanding of the programming language, compilers, microcontroller architectures and debugging tools. You are expected to keep a look out for upcoming advancements in the industry which will help optimize the product. To succeed as a Firmware Engineer, you should be focused on building a better, more efficient firmware while being able to navigate through obscure datasheets and sparsely documented vendor SDKs. This requires you to always be curious, collaborative and motivated. Main ResponsibilitiesYour responsibilities will include: • Would be asked to write efficient, modular and robust firmware which will interface with multiple components like MEMS sensors, battery chargers, secondary microcontrollers etc. • Writing clean, readable, and modular code • Would be deeply involved in the schematic design for a product which includes cost-benefit analysis of components, component evaluation by designing a proof of concept, suggestions in how the components should be connected etc. • Collaborate with software engineers who would develop companion applications to the product Key Requirements • 3+ years in developing firmware using C\C++• Should have worked with a ARM Cortex M series device like STM32, nRF52 etc• Familiar with basic data structures like linked lists, queues, trees etc.• Should be able to compile and link source code with static libraries without using an IDE• Basic knowledge of microcontrollers peripherals like UART, I2C, SPI, ADC etc Preferred Skills (Not Mandatory)• Worked with communications protocols like BLE/WiFi • Experience is PCB layout and schematic design • BTech or MTech or MSc or PhD in ECE, EEE, EIE or in related fields preferred with a strong technical knowledge.• Familiar with Python • Worked with equipment like logic analyzers, oscilloscopes etc.• Worked on microcontrollers from Dialog Semiconductors, Nordic Semiconductors,STMicroelectronics, Espressif etc. • Worked on projects involving DSP, AI/ML</p>
