Are you a topnotch high-impact developer who can design and write code that will scale and perform with our product and business? Can you take on the challenges of multi-geographical deployments with ever increasing data protection needs? Do you have new ideas that can be productized to improve our product? Do you have what it takes to take our product to the next level?If so, read on. Our client is making the world a better place by enabling organizations around the world — including 17 of the Fortune 25 — to both reduce their risk and lower their costs as they protect what matters: their sensitive data. The threats to our customers’ valuable data are ever increasing, and our adversaries are both well-funded and highly motivated to steal it, change it, or hold it hostage. Traditional layered security approaches that start with building a strong defensive perimeter are failing. Headlines and reports from around the globe and across all industries highlight the fact that yesterday’s “outside-in” security approach cannot protect against today’s sophisticated cyber threats. The company takes an “inside-out” data-centric approach to security, protecting their customers’ valuable data at the source vs. trying to secure the perimeter. They wrap themselves around the data at rest with their innovative technologies. Their data security technology foundation is encrypting data-at-rest and managing the encryption keys and access control for physical, cloud and Big data environments. Their data security solutions provide a single, centrally managed and scalable (to any size organization) solution to manage any key and encrypt any file or attachment (PDF files, Excel files, Word files, CAD files, etc.), any database (Oracle, DB2, MS SQL Server, My SQL, Sybase, and No SQL etc.), any application, anywhere it resides. This is done without sacrificing application performance while avoiding the complexity of key management. Our rapid growth provides unique opportunities for the right people to join a team that is ready to take the company to the next level. We are growing faster than the market, and we are investing aggressively in the areas of Cloud Security for Iaa S, Saa S and Paa S and enhancing data security solutions for HADOOP “Big Data” systems, SAP HANA and Mongo DB.
