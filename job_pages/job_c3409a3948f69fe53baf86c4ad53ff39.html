            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Company Profile Encore Semi Inc. is a rapidly growing and successful Engineering Services Company. Headquartered in San Diego, Encore Semi has a large portfolio of tier1 customers and engineers across the United States and Canada. Our Subject Matter Experts and teams of experts contribute to customer projects in the areas of So C design and embedded software life-cycle. Our focus and promise is to provide high-value to customers through acceleration, performance improvement, optimization, and risk mitigation. Department Profile In support of the high-demand from our customers, the Design Verification Group, led by Blair Milburn, Director of Verification / Validation (profile), is expanding and recruiting new members. This engineering service group is focused on deploying the most advanced verification techniques (SV/UVM/OVM, simulation/emulation/FPGA emulation) to flush bugs out of designs quickly and efficiently enabling high quality products to be delivered. As SOC designs are becoming more complex, the Verification environment is also growing in complexity. The Encore Semi Design Verification organization is looking for experts in modern Verification environments such as UVM to form a full-chip integration verification team for new SOC products and proof-of-concept designs. These experts would span multiple aspects of integration verification of SOC designs likely working in several different areas over the course of individual projects. Essential Duties/<br>Responsibilities:• /Functions/Tasks Build and adapt a SV/UVM environment to execute integration verification for a full-chip SOC proof-of-concept design<br>• The team would be executing verification of connections and protocols of the integration of various elements of the SOC to demonstrate functional correctness to enable assessment and demonstration of various performance characteristics of the target design<br>• Minimum<br>Qualifications:• Experience with Integration or “Full-Chip” Verification of SOCs built from existing, “pre-verified” IPs<br>• Focus is on test content development, including utilizing test sequences coming with an integrated IP, and execution against the full SOC model<br>• Experience using SV/UVM Verification environments in SV/UVM to flush out bugs as quickly as possible to deliver a highly functional first silicon<br>• Familiarity with updating and modifying SV/UVM environments is preferred BSEE or equivalent; 5+ years of Verification experience<br>• Preferred  Knowledge of using the JTAG interface for loading test content into a design and gathering results<br>• Knowledge of memory controllers and DDR memory, including PHYs, would be beneficial Broad “full-chip” verification experience would be a plus since members of this small team will need to work in multiple areas to execute against the verification plans rapidly Team Member Benefits See Culture and Benefits portion of Encore Semi website<br>• http://www<br>• encoresemi<br>• com/careers/culture-benefits/</p>
