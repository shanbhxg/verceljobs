            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Changing the world is all in a day's work at Apple. If you love innovation, here's your chance to make a career of it. You'll work hard. But the job comes with more than a few perks. When will rush hour start tomorrow? How long will it take for a traffic jam to clear up? How is a traffic jam affected by a nearby ball game? We are the real-time traffic team at Apple and we are looking to hire a Machine Learning Engineer to help answer questions like these in a real-time system Key Qualifications: Excellent Java, Scala, and/or C++ First-hand machine learning experience Bias for action Experience with GPS data and/or traffic models is a plus Description: The team's main responsibility is to measure and predict speeds for every road on the planet in real time. These speed values heavily influence routing and ETAs, as well as traffic display on the map. Your work will impact millions of peoples lives every day. You will be a key member of the team designing, implementing, and evaluating the real-time system that efficiently processes a massive stream of GPS and sensor data. We expect you to make substantial contributions to our traffic model, leveraging all this data to most accurately predict the future. This is a timely opportunity to work on exciting and challenging problems. You are self-motivated and data-driven, you test hypotheses and models by rapid prototyping, and you know how to identify and engineer the most promising models. You speak Java, Scala, and/or C++ (sometimes even on a whiteboard), you have first-hand experience with how different machine learning techniques scale, and you know how to greatly impact products.
