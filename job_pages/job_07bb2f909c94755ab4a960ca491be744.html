The DBA must possess the ability to create an efficient physical database design from a logical data model and application specifications.

A DBA must be able to translate a data model or logical database design into an actual physical database implementation and to manage that database once it has been implemented. * Backup and recovery. Implementing robust backup and recovery procedures is the insurance policy of the DBA. The DBA must implement an appropriate database backup and recovery strategy based on data volatility and application availability requirements. * Ensuring data integrity. DBAs must be able to design databases so that only accurate and appropriate data is entered and maintained. To do so, the DBA can deploy multiple types of database integrity including entity integrity, referential integrity, check constraints, and database triggers. Furthermore, the DBA must ensure the structural integrity of the database. * Performance management and tuning. Dealing with performance: the DBA must be able to proactively monitor the database environment and to make changes to data structures, SQL, application logic or the DBMS subsystem to optimize performance. * Ensuring availability.

The DBA must be able to ensure data availability using non-disruptive administration tactics. * SQL code reviews and walk-thru. The DBAs must possess in-depth SQL knowledge so they can understand and review SQL and host language programs and to recommend changes for optimization. * Capacity planning.
