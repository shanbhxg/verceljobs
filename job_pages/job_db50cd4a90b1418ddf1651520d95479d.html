            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Encore Semi Inc. is a rapidly growing and successful Engineering Services Company. Headquartered in San Diego, Encore Semi has a large portfolio of tier1 customers and engineers across the United States and Canada. Our Subject Matter Experts and teams of experts contribute to customer projects in the areas of So C design and embedded software life-cycle. Our focus and promise is to provide high-value to customers through acceleration, performance improvement, optimization, and risk mitigation. In support of one of our leading edge system customers, the Front-End Design Group is expanding to support the definition of a new High Performance Computing system. Initially, this team is looking for System Architects to define the structure and architecture for the hardware for a next generation energy-efficient large scale system built upon massive scaling of commercial processor components. Essential Duties/<br>Responsibilities:• /Functions/Tasks Leverage experience from academia and industry in High Performance Computing (HPC), examine the processor and data center components to scale commercial processor elements to deliver an energy-efficient massive scale system<br>• This Architect will create the overall definition to drive the overall system hardware composition<br>• Factors which will need to be considered are the power efficiency, manageability, reliability, and programmability (including ease of parallel programing)<br>• The end result will be a guide to system level hardware composition, silicon development, and, eventually, system level software<br>• The expectation is this will be a senior, experienced HPC architect who could define a sub-system or system level element (such as power management) for a large system<br>• Minimum<br>Qualifications:• Ph D in Computer Science or Computer Engineering<br>• Experience defining (architecting) sub-systems or elements of the hardware for a large HPC system is required with academic experience also being valuable<br>• Experience in one of the following areas of HPC architecture:Sub-system specification for any of the major sub-systems such as CPU/computing, Memory, high-speed IO, high-bandwidth interconnects System level protocols such as power management, inter-process/agent communication, debug / system monitoring Performance analysis of large HPC systems Computer hardware architecture experience in one or more areas: processors / CPUs, silicon based accelerators, distributed systems, high performance interconnect fabrics, high bandwidth memory sub-systems<br>• Experience documenting system architecture specifications for use by system or silicon development teams Preferred  Knowledge of HPC or datacenter architectures and acceleration techniques Queuing theory and development of analytical models to measure and evaluate system performance or computational math, numerical methods and linear algebra Experience developing software for HPC systems and parallel programming using Open MP or MPITeam Member Benefits See Culture and Benefits portion of Encore Semi website<br>• http://www<br>• encoresemi<br>• com/careers/culture-benefits/</p>
