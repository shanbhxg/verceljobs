This is a direct hire position located in Boston, MA. In addition to a highly competitive base salary, this position is bonus and equity eligible. Director, Deep Learning Data Architecture You will be joining a core team who has one purpose: the development and launch of this new suite of software products and tools that enable our enterprise clients to turn data into insights and client engagement. The development of these solutions is a critical initiative, backed by significant investment and is highly visible across the organization. We are guided by the belief that people are our greatest asset and are committed to attracting the best talent. In this position, you'll be responsible for providing expertise and hands on leadership in the design and development of a modern big data engine that will serve as the backbone for our new deep learning products. This includes sourcing into a data reservoir, managing complex access controls and encryption methodologies, developing ETL processes, integrating modern end-user software, and streamlining data consumption by data scientists, reporting teams and operational applications. We'll rely on your proven track record in data architecture and data management principles as well as artificial intelligence and deep-learning technologies. Specific responsibilities include:Design and develop highly scalable and optimized data models using modeling software to document and maintain versions to support Data Marts, Cubes, Data Warehouse, and Operational Data Stores (ODS).Perform source system analysis and meet with business leads to create appropriate requirement definition artifacts. Serve as a key voice in selection of technologies, equipment, and vendors. Develop, adapt and map general machine learning algorithms based on requirements of our software Invent new models that combine unsupervised and supervised learning with the kind of creativity usually reserved during novel computing paradigm creation Design and develop data quality rules for Data Warehouse and Data Mart solutions to ensure data integrity levels are met. Research new database and machine learning technologies and recommend solutions in order to meet requirements and long term performance scalability, & storage needs Develop data standards in terms of nomenclature, storage, design and deployments. Maintain the end-to-end vision of the data flow diagram and develop logical data models into one or more physical data repositories Document logical data integration (ETL) strategies for data flows between disparate source/target systems for structured and unstructured data into common data reservoir and the enterprise information repositories Develop and maintain controls on data quality, interoperability and sources to effectively manage corporate risk Train, lead, and mentor staff that may include database engineers and DBAs.
