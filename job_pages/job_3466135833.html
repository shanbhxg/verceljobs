            <p id="jobDescription">About the job Carbon Business @ ReNewYou will be co-leading the creation of a new business line. The business is working towards accelerating investments in carbon sequestration projects through appropriate carbon credit frameworks, thereby aiding global action and support for the cause.You get a chance to write rules of the game for carbon business(es) globally. You get to experiment, learn new things, develop a global view and visit some of the most remarkable places. You get to do all this, while saving the world from climate crisis.Carbon business aspires to ramp up its capability to be able to develop, invest in and implement projects globally, with an objective to generate tradeable carbon offsets. Investments have already been committed and these projects would be able to generate about 1Mn carbon credits per annum, for next 7 to 10 years. We intend to scale the business at a fast pace and get to next order of magnitude soon. Job Role Source, process, and analyze remotely sensed data, particularly high spatial resolution drone images, aerial photos, and satellite imagery, to support various ecological projects.Use various image analysis software, GIS, statistical analysis software, and data mining tools to develop accurate and relevant geospatial products (e.g. land use and land cover classification, vegetation species/species group classification, vegetation condition monitoring, invasive vegetation species detection, wetland classification, change detection, disturbance/restoration monitoring, water quality assessment, wildlife habitat monitoring, yield estimation, biomass modeling, species distribution modeling, site selection modeling, carbon modeling, etc).Collaborate with Engineers, Designers, Geospatial Analyst, Ecologist, and Project Managers to innovate new solutions or implement strategies to improve operational processes and/or fulfill project requirements.Design and implement remote sensing methodologies to innovate and create efficiencies to support many different projects across locations.Participate in field work where necessary in support of remote sensing projects.Develop innovative, intuitive remote sensing tools and automate task where possible.Provide support and guidance for UAV fleet management; help develop workflows, standard operational procedures, and documentation around UAV best practices for acquiring and processing data. Use various software packages to process UAV data creating useful end products such as orthomosaics, terrain models, NDVI, etc.Create remote sensing SOPs and provide remote sensing training to Geospatial staff.Prepare reports or presentations of relevant remote sensing/geospatial project information.Familiarity with and basic knowledge of relevant environmental regulationsFAA Part 107 sUAS Remote Pilot certification or UAV experienceKnowledge of running ecosystems models, such as APEX, for modeling carbon and nutrient cycles at site and landscape scales.Programming languages such as Python, R, and/or MATLAB Experience and educationA bachelorâ€™s degree in Geography, Geosciences, Environmental Sciences, Engineering, Remote Sensing, Ecology, Forestry, or related field.An expert understanding of active/passive sensor technologies, multispectral and radar imagery preprocessing, analysis, object-oriented classification, and pixel-based classification.Knowledge and experiences using the following applications: ArcGIS Pro and relevant extensions, eCognition Developer and Server, Erdas Imagine, Agisoft Metashape, Drone2Map, and statistical software, such as SAS and R.Knowledge using and applying artificial intelligence algorithms such as decision trees, random forest, and neural networks.A history of academic and professional success in the remote sensing field</p>
