Senior Machine Learning Engineer Pure Code Software is looking for an experienced, Machine Learning Engineer to join our talented and fast-growing team in Hyderabad, India. Using Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence, Pure Code’s first of its kind developer tool instantly turns software design images into fully functional React JS. Headquartered in Austin, Texas Pure Code Software recently raised $2 million USD from a top tier Silicon Valley venture capitalist. Pure Code offers a revolutionary developer tool that saves software engineering teams 25% of all the time required to build software, by using AI to generate code. Using computer vision; our code generator takes a web design (PDF, Figma file, Sketch file, etc.) and instantly generates dynamic, production-quality React JS markup. The product is loved by SAAS companies and web development agencies because it saves them time and money. We are a team of more than 30 and growing fast, funded by Tim Draper of Draper Associates and other high-profile tech investors. We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer as part of a cross-functional team that’s responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment.
