            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Position: Security Engineer Location: Alpharetta, GADuration: Long term contract Start: ASAPNOTES FROM THE HIRING MANAGER:- Expertise with CA Siteminder including development using Siteminder SDK. - Working experience with Federated identity and Web security concepts.- Deep Understanding of Web security/ network traffic patterns and ability to troubleshoot and act as the identity management SME in a complex environment - Develop applications based on Java and related technologies as per requirements.- Strong unix administration and scripting skills.- Past Experience with Identity management tools like (Sailpoint, Oracle).- Expertise with web technologies and architecture and associated application and web containers.- Background in Improving efficiency using Dev Ops model/tools and or automation tools Notes from the call:Will allow at least 1 day remote and probably more Will consider out of town candidates and will hire off Skype. Make sure they actually have experience not just certification. Dan hates when people just claim to be experts when all they have is certifications but no practical application (this is common) What the Client Wants:Building an Identity and Access Management team and doing an SSO project which involves Siteminder They are moving over to a new Identity Access Management System - Chose Sailpoint as IDM tool and a lot of the customizations are written in Java – so someone with a Java background can break that down and figure out those problems b/c they know how to develop in java. Disseminate how that app functions, and be able to fix it. Sailpoint IDM would be great to have but not required but need to have some of the relevant security tools (CA Suite: Siteminder, Identity Minder, etc, Sailpoint, Centrify, Cyber Ark, IBM Security tools, etc….there are several)Would consider either a Security/Identity Access Management Engineer, or a decent Java developer with the capacity to pick up with security or have experience doing development on security applications like IBM or Siteminder, since the new tool is built on siteminder. If they are a Security person – they can be an SSO person (CA) or an IDM Person (Sailpoint, Centrify, Cyber Ark, etc), but don’t have to be both. Working experience with Federated identity and Web security concepts SSO integrations – (these folks should know the CA Suite: Siteminder, identity minder, etc….Scripting – Can be a combo of the following Power Shell, Bash, Python, Perl. Understanding and experience with automation. Multifaceted on OS. IDM and CA is on Linux, so they need to know Linux but preferably can know some Windows too since they do have that in the environment as well. Note – During the interview - If they are asked what they use at home for their OS– they need to use Linux or Mac, if they say they’re developing on Windows at home is a red flag as it’s outdated and most people should at least have a Linux box. Have scripting on both sides of the house, then you get to applications or development side Java developers who can pick up toolsets and security technologies or have worked on security projects, meaning something like having done the development on Security engineer IDM or SSO, so they can do development but for security Size of the environments is less important in this role.
