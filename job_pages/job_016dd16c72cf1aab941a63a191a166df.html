(Portfolio of Android apps would be nice, though not required).Must be familiar with Open GL ES, since Scan UI uses it. Features like Triplex will probably heavily rely on Open GL. (i Phone rendering engine is also based entirely on Open GL under the hood).Experience with Open GL shaders would be a bonus. Must be familiar with writing high performance UI. For example, someone with Android 3D games experience might fit here. As UI/UX demanded more widgets, the Scan UI app started stuttering. Must have experience with interfacing Java UI code with C/C++ libraries using JNI. Experience with Open CV or Open CL libraries a plus. For example, we use Open CV for Sono HD. Experience working with embedded Android (e. g. building firmware from an Android tree) would be a bonus, though not required. Experience working with UI/UX folks is a bonus. Help keep UI design diverging too much from Android best practices and UI model. Experience with media codecs and frameworks a plus. Must have experience writing unit tests and other tests for an Android app. Must be willing to wear multiple hats.
