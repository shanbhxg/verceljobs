            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>We seek regular citizens, not professional drivers, to go about their normal routine as they usually do. Only with a big ad plastered on their car. The ads are typically vinyl decals that almost seem to be painted on the vehicle, and which often cover a large portion of the car's exterior surface. The car owner will be compensated weekly, which is essentially a "rental" payment for letting our company use that space. What does our company get out of this type of ad strategy?, Lots of exposure. The auto wraps tend to be colorful and eye-catching and attract lots of attention. Plus, it's a form of advertising with a captive audience, meaning people who are stuck in traffic and can't avoid seeing the wrapped car alongside them. Compensation: $230 weekl<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• y</p>
