            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>The role will be primarily a development role, working with the Qz Trades team and the larger Global Markets technology group globally to build out the Qz Trades application. This will include: • Designing and building financial product-agnostic APIs • Helping to onboard source systems to the platform • Helping to onboard consumers to the platform • Building tools for managing, monitoring and supporting the platform • Working the Quartz Core team to ensure decisions are being made in a manner consistent with the general Quartz strategy • Analysis and document ‘best practices’ for booking deals in Quartz, then work with the source systems to implement these recommendations Applications which are already onboarded to production Qz Trades will need to be maintained and improved, so there will be some level of discretionary enhancement and market-driven improvements. In the event of production outages, there is a support team – but the development team will act as a source of information and second-level support. It is expected that the successful applicant will be involved in these activities as well. EMAIL: nikitam@transreach. comphone:732-307-808<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• 1</p>
