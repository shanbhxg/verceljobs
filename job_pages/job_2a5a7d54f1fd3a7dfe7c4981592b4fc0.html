            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>About Audible: Audible, Inc. is the world's largest seller and producer of spoken audio entertainment, information and educational programming. Since inventing and commercializing the first portable digital audio player in 1997, our focus on technological innovation and superior programming has earned us millions of subscribers around the world. We're an Amazon subsidiary with a presence on three different continents, yet we maintain a startup vibe and small company feel. We offer more than 300,000 downloadable audiobooks, audio editions of periodicals, and other programs, and an escalating array of listening products that enrich daily life for a growing population of people who want to be more productive, well-informed, and thoughtfully entertained. The Team: The Platform group owns tools, frameworks and services that enables other development teams within the organization to build and ship software quickly and with a high bar of engineering excellence. This team builds awesome frameworks that development teams use to rapidly develop new experiences. We provide processes that keep our teams unblocked and highly productive but we do so in a way that's much more exciting than this sentence. We listen to our customers and the tech industry and it's our responsibility to push Audible into new places; wherever our customers are listening. That's really an excuse to experiment with things like adaptive streaming, home automation, wearables or even the Raspberry Pi. This opportunity specifically is on the services team within the Platform group. This team is building a 3rd party API that is being used internally and externally. We build the APIs that enable all Audible listening experiences whether through our apps, or externally. We are also evangelists for our API and work with business development and through events like external hackathons. We also build frameworks for other Audible teams to enhance productivity and scalability. Globally! We need your help to develop and deliver on this vision in an iterative manner. Success means we lay the foundation for continued expansion of our company without disrupting an already tremendously successful and much loved product. The Role: As an engineer on our team you'll be expected to write great code, execute on your ideas, challenge the status quo and generally make things better. You'll need the soft-skills too; Communication, influence and passion are key to the success of the team and ultimately the company. You'll experience all the challenges, ambiguity and opportunities of a new team with a new mission. How does Amazon fit in? We're a part of Amazon, they are our parent company and it's a great partnership. You'll get to play with all of Amazon's technologies like EC2, SQS and S3 but it doesn't stop there. Audible's built on Amazon technology and you'll have insight into the inner workings of the world's leading ecommerce experience. There's a LOT to learn! Your career will benefit from working with teams like Kindle, A9, P13N and many more.
