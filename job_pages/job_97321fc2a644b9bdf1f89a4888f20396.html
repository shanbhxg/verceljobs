            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Machine learning, large scale distributed systems; big data; low latency environments. If these areas resonate with you, then join us to work on extremely motivating challenges for the Amazon Advertising Platform supporting one of Amazon's most rapidly growing businesses. In North America alone, we process 50B advertising bid requests in under 30ms and evaluate our machine learning models to recommend the best response using our rich data. We leverage our petabyte scale data clusters to derive industry leading analytics and provide unique insights for our customers. And, we do this across desktop, mobile and video devices. We don't use the latest technologies because it's cool, we do it because there is no other way to work at this scale! For this role, we are looking for engineers at all levels to build our machine learning modeling pipeline and algorithm integration framework. You will be part of the developer team embedded in our science organization that is building our modeling platform and part of the overall data science and analytics systems org for advertising. Your platform automates the generation, validation, and publishing of models that incorporate all available data to predict performance against our customers' goals. You'll need to be both an engineer and scientist - you'll build the platforms to test and measure your hypotheses, iterate on your designs, and find innovative signals and solutions that fundamentally shift the effectiveness of our systems. About you: You are fascinated by the power of large scale distributed systems and using machine learning algorithms to optimize decision making. And you're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space. You will partner with research scientists to challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. You'll be given an opportunity to own and drive initiatives through the entire software stack -- from customer facing features, to algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume. Questions?: You may already know if you're a fit, but perhaps you're worried about technology and experience requirements? Don't be - we're looking for smart, proven, engineers; if you're the right candidate, we're flexible on level and scope.
