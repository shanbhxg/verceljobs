This position will partner with functions inside and outside of R&D. Additionally, this role will participate in Core Teams as representative of the systems team. Key deliverables for this role are technical requirements, architecture, trade-offs, and systems engineering process updates. This role will reside within the Systems Engineering Team whose charter is to grow and deploy systems engineering capability for product development across the U. S. Electronics R&D. We grow that capability through continuous learning as a systems engineering team based on experience gained through project assignments. DUTIES & RESPONSIBILITIESOn new product development projects, the systems engineering function is responsible for the following outcomes:Requirements Management Plan – based on scope of project, identify systems engineering tasks, deliverables and milestones Stakeholder Requirements – refine customer requirements into top-level system requirements that form the basis of system validation and input to systems requirements development System Requirements – based on Stakeholder Requirements, develop overall system requirements Risk Management Plan – scope of risk management activities to be performed Hazard Analysis – identify product risks, analyze and evaluate each risk, identify risk controls and verify risk controls Risk Management Report – summarize product's risk profile and risk acceptability Product Validation – showing that the finished product will meet the users' needs in the intended use environment. During subsystem development, the systems engineering function is responsible for explicating, correcting, and improving system specifications.
