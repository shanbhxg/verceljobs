            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>*U. S. Citizens only - due to federal contract**We do not work with third party*Title: Network Engineer Hours Per Week: Full-time A. Background:The NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Facility supports all NASA Mission Directorates and Mission Support Organizations in their use of NAS high-end computing resources to support their mission needs. The NAS Networking team provides advanced networking architectural planning, design, and integration in a state-of-the-art high- performance computing environment. The NAS environment is very dynamic and, as such, requires frequent modifications to the network infrastructure to meet changing systems, user, and NASA/federal policy requirements. The NAS Networking and Security teams accomplish this by working closely with NAS management, other groups, and users to ensure the NAS network (NASLAN) meets those requirements. To support this world-class organization, we strive to identify, architect, and implement optimal network engineering and network/security tools for this critical NASA resource. B. Position Description This position is responsible for the network engineering support of a high-performance network environment. This support includes (but is not limited to) design, integration, and support of NASLAN, a network consisting of a 10G backbone, a 1G/10G supercomputing ‘enclave’, and a 1G/10G access/desktop network. In addition, this position will provide performance analysis, working with users and admins at remote sites to identify performance bottlenecks and recommend solutions, development and/or maintenance of network tools, and collaboration with other groups at NAS and other advanced networking organizations. Activities include (but are not limited to):Analysis of TCP/IP issues, system tuning and troubleshooting, and data transfer application troubleshooting. Network testing, integration, and maintenance/operational support. Maintains routine data network hardware and systems; investigates, resolves and/or escalates network and hardware matters of significance; researches, analyzes and isolates errors; assists in assessing and updating older networks as needed and in accordance with specified plans. Provides first line technical support on data networks for internal and/or external customers; answers routine technical questions; recommends and implements approved course of action. Installs and maintains network infrastructure, including hardware, software, and system data for high-performance networks. Installs network applications on network servers; maintains, tests, researches and resolves problems. Determines appropriate standard testing routines. May test various network- related equipment such as routers, switches, or optical equipment or multi- function switches, etc. for maintenance. Assists in designing, and implements and maintains various networks such as LAN and WAN systems in accordance with specified requirements. Prepares data network diagrams and drawings to document and assist in communicating current operation status of networks. Performs network equipment configurations and configuration changes of various data equipment such as routers, switches, etc. to enhance performance. Prepares routine proposal documentation and information to meet customer requirements. Assists in routine cost analyses and vendor comparisons to ensure cost-effective and efficient operations, and measures feasibility of various approaches. C. Qualifications Bachelor's degree or equivalent combination of education and experience. Bachelor's degree in engineering, computer science, management information systems, or related field preferred. Experience with networking protocols (OSPF, BGP, STP, HSRP, IPv4/6)Three or more years of experience in high-availability production data networks. Experience working with current local area network systems and technical infrastructure communication issues. Experience working with current network systems and networking principles. Experience working with network software and hardware (Cisco Catalyst preferred). CCNP or related certifications a plus. User-level Linux/Unix experience (user-level Mac OS X experience a plus).Analytical and problem solving skills. Skilled in time, priority, and task management. Interpersonal skills to interact with customers and team members. Communication skills to interact with team members and support personnel. Ability to work independently and as part of a team. Ability to manage competing priorities in a complex environment. Ability to convey a professional image and deal confidently with technical problems. Basic programming skills related to web design (Linux, PHP, Perl, etc.) a plus. Must be able to lift 50 lbs (e. g. rack-mounting equipment, occasional sub-floor work). Be able to work in a data center environment. D. Network Engineer and Deliverables This job is primarily a network engineering position, and requires the candidate to be able to perform network-engineering functions with supervision from senior-level network engineers. Duties include sustaining engineering of the NASLAN network environment on the NS3 contract. This is a 24/7/365 operation, so Point of Contact (POC) duties are required (on a rotating basis) once the engineer is up to speed. The other component of this job entails project/development work, and has the following deliverables:Assist with identifying poor user network performance and remedy. (Weekly Report)Assist with monitoring network performance on HECC LAN. (Monthly Report by 5th working day of the month)Support network equipment (routers, switches, servers) upgrades. (Monthly Report by 5th working day of the month)Assist with the generation and maintenance of the NASLAN diagrams. (Diagram updates due by 10th working day of the month)Provide weekly reports to the Networks manager (by each Monday COB)Complete training exercises to understand the NASLAN environment as assigned by the Network Manager (Progress included in weekly reports).Provide layer 1 support of the NAS computer rooms (Progress included in weekly reports).Work on daily tickets to configure ports for Hostmaster and Connection requests. (Ongoing) NOTE: This deliverable is for task 4E. E. Travel/Training Travel: There is an annual Supercomputing conference in which NASA participates. The NAS Networks team supports the NASA booth network each year, and thus travel is required to the site of the conference (different locations each year, 2 weeks of travel).Training: The Networks Manager will work with the employee to define a training plan.
