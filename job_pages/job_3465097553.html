With the pace of the growth, comes the need for bright people to keep the engine revving. We are looking for people who can help us grow by identifying opportunities in the US healthcare payer market, create meaningful propositions and taking that to the market. If you are looking for the thrill that comes with wins and the curiosity to uncover business problems that the payer market faces, the rest of the details here might excite you! If complacency or predictability is what you seek, this role isn’t in the same zip code. However, if your ambition makes you chase daunting targets and pitch yourself against the best Solutioning experts out there, then you may find this to your taste. Here are a few things you will find yourself doing in this role.· Identify Opportunities – Successful delivery is a skill, effective Solutioning is an art. Your understanding of various segments in the US healthcare market should equip you to for an effective assessment, spot gaps and envision solutions to create business value. The perceived result should be generating business opportunities for us while generating tangible business value for the prospects/customers.· Design propositions – Experts solve problems, genius lies in identifying and defining problems. If you are someone who loves in-depth analysis of market landscape, understands end-users and their context, crystalizes the problem statement and then shape value propositions that can be taken to the market, you have met the right challenge. · Craft solutions – We do understand that you may not be a tech whizz However, an ability to understand the ‘how’ behind the ‘what’ is what we like. So if you have an inventor mind-set, you might fit right in. Based on understanding of the market/customer requirements, you would be creating solutions that delight end-users. Estimation, planning and coordination will obviously accompany your objectives.· Enabling sales - The best kind of learning happens when you are in the field. Talking to prospects/customers imparts you knowledge of market reality for which there aren’t many substitutes. In this role, you would be interacting with the prospects during sales calls to understand their challenges, needs and context. This will enable you to craft meaningful solutions later.· Kick-starting accounts – As you might already have expertise in certain areas of healthcare, we would like you to put that to use. You would be engaging with the customers directly, setting up the necessary framework/processes and starting new accounts. This obviously requires unquestionable expertize in the relevant area. Within 2-3 months, you would hand-over the account to another Business Analyst who would run the show from thereon.· Contribute to Marketing - There need to be ways to measure learning for it to be effective and complete. We think the best judge of that is the audience. You would be generating content based on your understanding of various areas and aspects of US healthcare and publishing it. The idea would be to get the relevant audience interested in those and get them to talk to us. Feels daunting?? Challenging things always are!· Gain expertize in new areas – Most of the time the learning graph tapers off after 3-4 years of comfort zone. To help you grow, we would help you learn.
