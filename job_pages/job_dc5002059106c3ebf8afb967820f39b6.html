            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Alar Software is Hiring Backend Engineers We are looking for experienced software engineers to help build out our platform. We're aiming to aggregate logistics data enabling customers to operate more efficiently and connect them with other logistics companies. We believe we're on to something big, but to get there we're working through complex problems in a complex domain. We're attacking those problems with an unconventional approach (event sourcing with a twist) and dealing with big data to boot. This isn't a run of the mill MVC app. Because of this complexity, we're limiting our search to two kinds of people: experienced engineers who can bring structure to the chaos as we grow, or those applicants who can make up for lack of experience with passion and creativity. Please don't apply unless you can demonstrate one of these somehow. A little about us We are not a typical startup. We're the skunkworks offshoot of an existing logistics company - we founded this startup to address logistics challenges we've faced since we started that company nearly 20 years ago. It turns out most of our competitors face the same problems, and the industry at large isn't making much progress to solve them. So the solutions we're developing are targeting real problems with real monetization potential. The founders have a good understanding of both the logistics industry and programming - so working with us isn't going to be an exercise in dealing with a pointy haired boss. We believe in solid development practices that avoid technical debt, and want to focus on product quality above all else. We also believe in independence and accountability - I'm not looking to add 'babysitter' to my job description. We've been trying to tackle these problems in some fashion for many years, but development only really picked up in the last year. Right now we've got a remote team of 10, but we're looking to build a local team here in Chicago - the complex nature of the problems and the domain means we're really going to benefit from having a solid core group with lots of facetime. Our stack Primarily C#. Working to get our backend running on akka. net, although we're also considering Scala as we gain more experience with akka. Also a bit of postgres, some simple mongo for non-critical functions, and ASP. NET. What You ll Do Help design the core architecture that will drive our platform Tackle problems unique to integrating big data What You ll Need Backend C# experience, big data experience a plus Talent for creative and functional solutions to difficult problems Strong computer science fundamentals A stomach for working in a fast-paced and uncertain problem domain Ability to ship quality code quickly Compensation Competitive base salary Stock options Medical, dental, and other benefit<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• s</p>
