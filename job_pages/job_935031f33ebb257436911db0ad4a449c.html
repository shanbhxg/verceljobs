            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Principal Software Engineer - Signal Processing Considering a job change in 2016? Then this is a great time to join health technology client and make a difference in patients' lives. In this elite, start-up like, division of a major company (located near Alewife T in Cambridge), they are developing a leading edge Rhythmia Mapping system creates high-resolution 3D models of the human heart, used by physicians to treat cardiac arrhythmia. Also the company offers an excellent salary and large company benefits, and a 15% bonus. They will also do a green card sponsorship on an outstanding candidate, but currently there is no relocation (or interview) assistance. As the Signal Processing Algorithm Development Engineer you will have a leading role in the design and development of novel signal processing algorithms and tools for cutting edge medical applications in the field of Cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis and treatment. The responsibilities will include:Developing and implementing novel signal processing algorithms applied to biological signals. Drive system level enhancements for advanced tracking technology from prototyping to release. Collaborate across disciplines effectively (HW, SW, Systems and Clinical) to achieve highest quality solutions for the patient. WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING APPLICANTS WITH COMMERCIAL EXPERIENCEWe are seeking people with a Master’s Degree in Electrical Engineering or equivalent. You will also need at least 5 years of product development experience in a commercial environment. Core engineering skills:Expert in MATLAB or equivalent Linear systems analysis (time/frequency, estimation & feedback models, adaptive filters)Digital filter design Experience with C/C++ or equivalent A plus, Experience with algorithm design for real-time systems A plus, Optimization fundamentals Familiarity with lab equipment (signal generator, oscilloscope, Lab View, etc.) Also there is a second similar position as a Principal Software Engineer (DSP/C++)Seeking a software developer who can develops signal processing algorithms for the device Looking at algorithms that can track where the catheter is in the heart..i. e developing algorithms to track where the device is. ( The other(above) role involves designing and developing code that 'translates' the signals to create the images ) Must have: Matlab, C++Linear Systems Analysis Digital Filter Design This person knows how to use algorithms for a real time system i. e. tracking the heart in action This person will be working on their own doing the algorithm<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• s</p>
