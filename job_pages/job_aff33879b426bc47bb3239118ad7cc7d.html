You will work primarily on the infrastructure side, as a developer. First and foremost you need to be a solid Java expert with strong concurrency and core principles. You will work on data feeds, dealing with IM-based communications firm-wide, and tailoring our services toward the wide range of clients in the front office realm. You will also work as a data scientist. No specific experience is needed in that field, but you should have a strong math background and be interested in working with data. ML experience is helpful, but not necessary. Some database background, with SQL/Oracle would also be beneficial. We use a range of Java tools, like Spring, but aren’t looking for a Spring developer. You should be an OO specialist, with strong data structures and CS basics, as well as solid knowledge of JVM. We have excellent benefits, offer bonuses and fair compensation, as well as the opportunity to be on the forefront of all the advances in the field.
