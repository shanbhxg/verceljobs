            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Geomagical Labs is an early-stage technology startup in the SF Bay Area, applying novel computer vision technologies to mass-scale consumer applications. We are building a visual-inertial SLAM engine from scratch, using several state-of-the-art innovations. We have openings for imaginative, hands-on, computer scientists, with a background in Visual SLAM, to own substantial parts of our smartphone SLAM engine. Ideal candidates will be highly-motivated applied researchers with exceptional hands-on development skills, entrepreneurial drive, and enthusiasm to develop amazing software used by millions of people. Candidates should have practical experience with keyframe and filtering-based visual SLAM systems, solid understanding of multiple view geometry, experience with inertial sensor kinematics, and enthusiasm for pushing the envelope. This position requires strong theoretical foundations, excellent software development skills, sound scientific method, and a taste for adventure. Requirements Strong computer science foundations, with focus on vision and/or robotics (M. S./Ph. D. strongly preferred). Enthusiastic about seed-stage startups; entrepreneurial, comfortable with risk & uncertainty Hands-on experience developing visual SLAM systems for AR, vision, or robotics,applications Familiar with multiple SLAM approaches, including keyframe BA and probabilistic filtering Solid applied math skills in linear algebra, 2D/3D geometry, and linear & non-linear optimization. Experience using inertial IMU data (gyros & accelerometers) in SLAM systems Strong software development skills in Linux environments Significant hands-on experience with computer vision feature-level fundamentals (feature detection, correspondence matching, and tracking) Real-time software experience desired Mobile app development experience desired (i OS, Android) U. S. work visa is strongly desired - We will sponsor H1-B visas for candidates, but given visa uncertainty, we strongly prefer candidates to have an existing U. S. work visa. Benefits Rare opportunity to join an early tech startup adventure when it is less than ten people. Be part of the core team responsible for inventing and productizing influential new technologies. Substantial stock equity packages, of the sort only available at early startups. We are located in Mountain View, California, but we have technical staff located around the globe. We prefer local candidates. but are open to remote work/telecommuting or part-time consulting for the right candidate<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• </p>
