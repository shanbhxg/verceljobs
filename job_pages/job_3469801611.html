            <p id="jobDescription">About the job Perceptyne Robots – Embedded Systems Engineer (L3,4) – JD About Perceptyne: While robotic automation has come a long way from the time everything was manual, even today, robots struggle when it comes to automating tasks that need dexterity: like product assembly, packing and kitchen preparations. Founded by IIT & BITS alumni, Perceptyne is a deep-tech robotics company building highly dexterous robots that can automate these tasks in a scalable manner. At Perceptyne, we are building disruptive technology that will push the boundary of robotics as we know it today! (www.perceptyne.com) How is it like to work at Perceptyne? At our core, we like to build things, we evangelize great ideas, and we are grounded in reality. At Perceptyne, we greatly value these dichotomies: Having experience while not losing a first principles approach. Having a large vision while not losing attention to detail Working on disruptive tech while hitting the market ASAP Work Description: As an embedded systems engineer (L3/4), you are expected to execute all aspects of electronics development on our robot. Your everyday activities would include: system/sub-system level decisions, schema simulations, component selection, schematic capture, PCB design, control algorithm development, firmware programming, testing and production scale-up. Skills / Requirements: Experience Requirements: Bachelors / Masters in Electronics Engineering or equivalent (ECE / EEE / EIE / Mechatronics) >4 years of relevant work experience Technical skill Requirements: Circuit design skills: Good understanding & experience of designing sub-sections of boards like power supply management, micro-controller subsystems, ADC/DAC circuits, protection circuits, isolation circuits etc. Extensive knowledge of various electronic components available in the market. Good understanding of signal integrity, reliability, grounding, and isolation guidelines. Good understanding of various figures of merit (specifications) in datasheets Good understanding of all basic circuit configurations: Voltage divider, Pull-up / Pull-down circuits, Inverting / Non-inverting amplifier, RC / LC filters, MOSFET based switches, AC coupling techniques, Biasing techniques, Buck / Boost converters etc. Excellent proficiency with schematic capture and PCB design tools. Dexterity with test equipment (Oscilloscopes, Signal Generators, DMMs etc.) is a must Firmware development experience: Good proficiency in firmware development, based on C Strong experience using IDEs, debuggers and other tools from one or more popular microcontroller vendors Ability to write well architected, modular, documented code Strong debugging skills Proficiency in LabVIEW / MATLAB / VHDL is a big plus Good understanding of control systems is a big plus Soft skill Requirements Passionate about Robotics & DIY projects Systematic approach to work, documentation, and tracking. Be resourceful, creative about getting things done with a sense of urgency Be curious of whatever is happening in the company and pitch in wherever you think you can learn or add value.</p>
