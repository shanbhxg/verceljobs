Candidates should be skilled in large-scale, highly available Saa S architecture and also be proficient in CI/CD, configuration management, infrastructure and application monitoring, and networking. Experience working directly with customers is required, and prior experience working with partner ecosystems is a plus. Previous AWS experience is preferred but not required.
