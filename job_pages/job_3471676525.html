Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes? Are you the best coder you know? Do you want to apply your expertise to building apps that delight millions of customers? At Trilogy, we develop some of the most innovative cloud-native software solutions across multiple verticals. We are hiring the best coders in the world to tackle the most complex needs in our portfolio. Trilogy uses cloud-native technologies to improve software products for dozens of customers, and we are looking for the most talented programmers to help us. We have reinvented the software development process to break down product specs and milestones into individual code challenges with 4-8 hour SLAs, and your job is to crack the problem as quickly as possible. This role pays a USD 200k salary and provides the chance to double your compensation as you move up the Engineering ladder. The future of work started long ago with us. Home office twice a week? We have been working from wherever we want for the last fifteen years in our 100% remote model. While scrum rituals and daily standups are still dominating the rest of the industry, our team is already operating under a global asynchronous model where each developer follows 8-hour shifts three or four days a week, plans the rest of their workweek flexibly, and never exceeds 40 hours. The development operates 24x7, but you are free to choose your own schedule! What You Will Be Doing Designing innovative commercial software and writing high-quality code to bring them into production. Implementing new features on existing software products by solving complex implementation problems and making the appropriate technical decisions. Fixing bugs to permanently eliminate defects that impair product functionality. What You Won’t Be Doing Dealing with unclear expectations or non-technical managers. Every task will have a clear scope and objective for you to implement. Executing repeated tasks for the same product using the same tech stack. Our portfolio of 60+ products ensures you are always tackling new challenges. Non-technical tasks. This is a role for those who love coding and want to dedicate time to solving complex technical issues. Software Development Specialist Key
