            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Long term contract in North Chicago, ILStrong business PMAgile experience is key. They just implemented Agile so are not 100% agile yet and need someone that would be a good advocate for Agile. Need to decipher and know when to push and not to push towards Agile. Need to be well polished and have good communication, strong leader and able to talk to executives. Not a sub-par PM who could “do the job”.Agile and ERP implementation experience. Agile is new here. They will need to be strong enough to advocate and know where flexing makes sense. Cycle times will be a bit long for agile at 12 weeks. Someone with both experience on app dev and Saa S projects would be sweet, but I'm willing to give that up for someone with great business side PM experience. HR experience is more important than healthcare. First priority is business PM. Saa S and app dev would be helpful. Communicate clearly and succinctly<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• </p>
