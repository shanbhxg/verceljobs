            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>About us: Ahmedabad International School (AIS) was founded 22 years ago, on the belief that self-learning leads to lifelong learning. The AIS community inculcates a love for learning, fosters social and emotional acuity, develops responsible global citizens, and builds a strong academic foundation. AIS is an IB World School where students fall in love with learning, discover their passions, and prepare for the world beyond the classroom. AIS is over 1600 students strong across K-12 with some of the finest placements in the world. AIS alumni are represented at Stanford, Columbia, Cornell, Brown, Carnegie Mellon, Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial, St. Andrews, IITs, NLUs, and many more distinguished universities. Our goal is to build a learning community like no other - one where students and teachers feel empowered to do their best work. AIS teachers are critically reflective practitioners who wear multiple hats - facilitators, mentors, learners, friends, researchers, and collaborators. They ask and ponder over hard questions like ‘what is the role of a teacher when information is available at a click’, ‘how do we design learning that is challenging and significant’, and much more. Maker Space @AIS The Maker Space at AIS is a place for learners to express ideas, learn new skills, explore interests, collaborate and create personally meaningful projects. It caters to every child's innate urge to make their creative ideas come alive and provides them with confidence that their ideas & creations can change the world. Throughout the academic year, the Maker curriculum provides an opportunity to learn STEM-related skills in ICT, Digital Art and Media, Automation, Electronics, Materials & Structures etc. Learners apply these skills, along with design thinking, to create projects that are useful or expressive Maker Space Team @AIS We are building a team of creative, curious and passionate educators for the Maker Space program at Ahmedabad International School Job responsibilities: Designing STEM curriculum and lesson plans reflecting the IB philosophy and PBL pedagogy Conducting daily sessions in skill building and design thinking at Maker Space for K-12 learners Mentoring learners’ projects that require expertise in multiple disciplines Creating engaging learning content and resources in written, visual and other formats Supervising makerspace inventory and equipment Creating in-house projects to promote maker culture among team members, teachers and learners Exemplify and promote the ethos of the maker movement Required Skills and Experience: 4+ years of experience in designing and delivering Robotics & Electronics curriculum Experience in project-making with Embedded systems, Sensors, Actuators, Machine Design etc Coding Experience: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Scratch, Python etc Exposure to technologies like Io T, AR-VR, AI etc Excellent communication skills: Written and Verbal Willingness to acquire skills in other domains Demonstrate the compassion, curiosity and leadership of an educator Experience in engaging and building communities with a shared visio<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• n</p>
