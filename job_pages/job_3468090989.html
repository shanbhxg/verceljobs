About us Innovation is fueled by the power of possibilities. Till recently, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed tech know-how. It was simply too expensive, too complex and too risky. That’s why 78% of all software projects failed. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or participate in boot camps to learn how to build your own app. Builder. ai’s platform lets you order your software app for the problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI-powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life. Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi. Demand for our services has been incredible, meaning we’ve been able to raise $100m in Series C funding. Life at Builder. ai It’s a place where everything moves at lightning speed and it’s certainly not for the faint of heart. We celebrate diversity and push everyone to do more with less, while creating and championing a culture that empowers everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.
