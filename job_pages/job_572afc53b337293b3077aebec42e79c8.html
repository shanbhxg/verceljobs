You will work with leading companies in this space and directly with the engineering teams within Amazon developing these new capabilities. Overview: The AWS Support team is seeking engineers who enjoy solving problems, working with customers, and have technical backgrounds from a variety of different fields including Linux/Windows systems administration, database design and optimization, big data analysis, network administration, and dev ops. The Windows role primarily supports customers running Server OS versions from 2003 through 2012R2 on top the bedrock service of EC2. EC2 is our virtual compute engine and forms the backbone of additional services such as EMR and RDS. Additional Windows based services focused on include Work Spaces (VDI), Directory Service (enterprise scale user/group management), Work Docs (collaborative documentation sharing) as well as Microsoft Systems Center and v Center management plugins. Support engineers may field general guidance questions from customers such as setting up a small website using IIS up to troubleshooting and reproducing complex performance issues from customers running fleets of server instances interacting with multiple services across several AWS regions. Our support engineers are also the "voice of the customer" and have a strong voice in to the development teams for recurring issues or feature requests. If you're experienced in Windows system administration and you are more comfortable "getting your hands dirty" than using a search engine for solutions, then we're looking for you!
