Instead, think year one, and beyond. For example, consider this position we're working on. It involves a medium-sized (150 person) New York-based Internet start-up that asked us to find them an IT Specialist and help them become as big as their dreams. As a result, you will, too! That's the stuff beyond year one. If you're interested, here's what year one is all about. For an IT Specialist, this is the stuff of dreams - getting out and working in a hands-on role for an amazing company that cares about its employees and clients.1) Overseeing and taking ownership of our company infrastructure2) Migrating and updating our current IT Systems to the latest and best support environment (We work with both Windows and Microsoft)3) Updating and managing office equipment as needed4) Managing and providing desktop support for all employees5) Managing and troubleshooting all Network issues6) Overseeing our Cisco phones and Shoretel-based Vo IPRealistically, we need someone with 2 to 3 years experience supporting an IT department (you don't learn these things overnight). Coming from a competitor of ours would add a lot of credibility. Most important is a hands-on understanding of the complexities of IT and Desktop Support. Also important is the creativity and focus to thrive at a growing company. If you pull all of this off, the VP of Operations will be thanking you!While this is all of the Year One and Beyond Stuff, Day One is pretty good, too. These are things like the compensation, the company, the people, and the location. However, none of this matters unless "Year One and Beyond" makes career sense for you. The best IT Specialists are knowledgeable, passionate, and multi-functional. They have the ability to work directly with all employees, from peers to executives. They know the infrastructure systems inside and out. Their greatest skills are their knowledge, technical saavy, hands-on experience, and drive. A strong predictor of success for this person is the ability to handle and troubleshoot multiple issues at once. There are no direct reports for this role.
