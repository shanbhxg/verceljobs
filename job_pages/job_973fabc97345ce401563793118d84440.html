SSL certificates to secure all traffic going to and from web based prodcts, the development of replicated servers and associated mechanisms to assure that if a server is comprimised it can be "swapped" out in real time without affecting the user's experience, building out payment gateways which have up to date PCI DSS and ISO 27001 certification which are up to date, the development of two factor authentication mechanisms, security information and event management solutions which give the organization a visual overview of attacks in real time, among VPN's and DNS services to blacklist and prevent access to software products being built, than this job is for you!
