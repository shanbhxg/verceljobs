Complete greenfields and total ‘buy in’ from the CEO to give this new team whatever they need to be successful. Several new teams being formed, head up by successful startup leaders that were specifically brought in to establish these new teams. The Director that is leading the new R&D team is my direct contact and is someone that I have placed at another highly successful startup company. Director looking to make first hires for this new R&D team. Key hire is a Lead Engineer, about 90% hands-on and will share implementation responsibilities with the Director.

The new Lead must also be able to architect a solution and deploy a team to implement the solution – remaining hands-on and leading by example.
