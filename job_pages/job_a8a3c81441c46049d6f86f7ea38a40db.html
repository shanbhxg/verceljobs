The role requires regular communication with both technical and non-technical project leaders, business and development stakeholders as well as leadership at the executive level. The Environment Management Lead will gather requirements from project leadership teams and build a plan to perform necessary environment changes in order to meet those requirements. This plan frequently involves establishing meetings and communication channels with development and administrative contacts to confirm the overall plan is in sync across all teams prior to the implementation phase. Constant contact must be maintained with application developers and administrators while in the various phases of environment preparation. Therefore, it is imperative the Environment Management Lead is available to answer questions and offer solutions to environment problems as they arise. The Environment Management Lead must perform in a fast paced organization that is continually improving and creating efficiency. Communication and negotiation skills are critical due to stringent requirements and resources. The Environment Management Lead is accountable for ensuring that environments are ready for QA and other testing teams on time. To ensure delivery dates are met, environment-related defects will be triaged with appropriate development and / or administrative leads quickly and effectively.

Missed deadlines directly result in impacts to the project timelines and potentially delaying product releases. A general understanding of agile product development will help in being successful in this role.
