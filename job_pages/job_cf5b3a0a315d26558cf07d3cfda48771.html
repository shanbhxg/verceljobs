            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>The New York Times is looking for an engineer to create and contribute to APIs and systems development in support of our world-renowned games products, including Crosswords and the upcoming diversification into new games and platforms. A little more about us:The Games team is a small, cross-functional team within The New York Times tasked with building great puzzle experiences on a variety of devices and platforms. We’re evolving our existing Crosswords portfolio and developing a native Android app, continuing to iterate on the gameplay experience on i OS, experimenting with new puzzles that we are building from the ground up, and are heavily investing in our API infrastructure to enable new types of gameplay, create more maintainable code, and enable new product experimentation with ease. Our team cuts across all disciplines and are staffed by people who are passionate about our products and work together to provide a world-class experience for everyone who plays our games. Our group focuses on user-centered design, and is composed of tightly knit, interdependent representatives from product and project management, development and design. Through iteration, testing, empathetic research and experimentation, the games that are delivered constantly evolve, and the team members constantly strive for improvement. Who we’re looking for:We are looking for an experienced API engineer, who can think through complex data access problems, enjoys iterating on models and thinking through their impact on downstream systems and the clients that consume them, and is passionate about simplicity in the infrastructure and flow that supports these systems. We use some of the more interesting ways of creating APIs, including hosting on AWS and GCP, building systems with Go and Node, thinking through the implications of API Gateway and Kong, technologies like Lambda, balancing protobuff performance vs JSON simplicity, and how message queuing can save the world. As a result, a key focus of this role is an appreciation for learning what is new and interesting in high-performance, high-availability service-oriented architecture, while ignoring most of it in favor of fast iteration, predictable delivery and domain expertise. To be successful in this role, you must…Appreciate thinking about Swagger vs RAML vs Blueprint, but understand when they can be irrelevant Understand the value of data model mocks and versioned schemas, and how to collaboratively author these with consumers Evangelize that designing data interfaces (be it REST, Graph QL, Falcor or the like) is a task that takes as much care and consideration as traditional product design, but for a technical audience Be able to work through complex caching situations to deliver high-speed data access in all situations Requirements and experience…Many years of hands-on authoring of APIs, preferably with Node, Go or Python Knowledge of multiple methods for creating APIs (frameworks, scaffolding, and why one would be preferable to another in different situations)Company Information: The New York Times Company (NYSE: NYT) is a global media organization dedicated to enhancing society by creating, collecting and distributing high-quality news and information.
