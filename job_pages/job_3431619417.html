Additional Information:
The role in a nutshell:You will build efficient path to production for various software systems. You will also ensure the reliability and scalability of these systems in production. The biggest highlight of this role:You work on software systems which are live in production and get to see the business impact of your code changes. Your day to day responsibilities:Infrastructure automation - You will create infrastructure as a code (Ia C) and automate manual processes using tools like Bash. Deployment automation - You will automate the deployment of applications and services to staging and production environments. This includes building CI, CD pipelines, containerisation and orchestration of workloads, configuration management, etc. Ensuring scalability - You will build auto-scaling systems that scale up or down based on user demands. Ensuring observability - You will build observability into systems, making it easier to find and resolve issues before they blow up in production. Performance and Cloud cost optimisation - You will implement ways to improve system performance and optimise cloud costs. Client engagement - At One2N, you will work directly with client teams everyday. You will drive and own key project decisions. Evaluating technology choices and approaches - “Should I choose Kubernetes or Nomad?”. “Should I self-host my CI servers or use a Saa S solution?” These are some of the questions that you will explore answers to, considering the possible technical and financial trade-offs. Documentation - Meticulously create RCAs, runbooks and checklists and follow them diligently. Support on call when needed - You own the reliability of systems which are live on production. Therefore, you are expected to be available on call to fix prod issues. We keep checks and balances (for e. g. “follow the sun” on-call rotation) to ensure your work-life balance. Technologies and concepts you will work on:Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Git Hub Actions, Argo CD, AWS, GCP, Bash, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, ELK stack, Datadog etc. Our programming language of choice is Go.__________________________________________________________________________________________Some of our work includes:Auto-scaling e KYC Machine Learning workloads to handle 2 Million API requests/day Migrating 1.3TB of primary data from self-hosted My SQL to GCP Cloud SQLBuilding a control plane for multi-cluster Kubernetes setup Implementing Git Ops for continuous deployment of microservices Migrating background jobs from VMs to Kubernetes using KEDA.__________________________________________________________________________________________What we expect you to possess: Must have skills:Understanding of basic bash scripting and computer networking (SSH, TCP, HTTP).Experience with using a programming language (we primarily use Go) to build a basic REST API. Experience with using Git as a version control system. Experience with any of the cloud providers (AWS, GCP, etc) to deploy a three-tier web app. High level idea of system components (databases, cache, reverse proxies, CDNs) to understand how and where they fit in the big picture. Experience in creating CI, CD pipelines to build and deploy at least a simple REST API application to dev/prod environments. Good to have skills:Ability to take code from the local to prod by implementing Continuous Integration and Delivery principles. Exposure to building, scaling and deploying software using 12-factor app (https://12factor. net/) principles. Experience of working with Microservices and use of container orchestration tools like Kubernetes/Nomad. Experience with using Observability tools and setting up monitoring and alerting for microservices using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, or ELK stack or Datadog and the likes. Implementing everything as code - from infra, to policies, security, configuration, etc. using relevant tools such as Terraform, OPA, Ansible etc. Experience with building cloud-agnostic homogenous deployment solutions. Don’t worry too much about being a perfect fit for each of these requirements. If you believe that you have the potential to take up this role, feel free to apply
