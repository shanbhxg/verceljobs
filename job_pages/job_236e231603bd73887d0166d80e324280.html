Our services are engineered for high availability, maximum reach, and cost savings that we can pass on to customers. We enable the world to watch video instantly, from any device, whether on the road or from the comfort of a living room sofa. Today, we deliver Movies and TV shows to Windows and Mac PCs, portable devices, gaming consoles, smart phones, and smart TVs. We operate in the US, Japan, UK, Germany, and Austria, and we aspire to grow -- a lot. As a member of the Metadata team, you will be focused on building the world's richest video metadata store! In this role, you will be responsible for engineering the systems that ingest and store metadata from a variety of providers (e. g., film studios, IMDb) and you will design and implement systems that generate proprietary metadata that drives our user experience. As an owner of the metadata storage platform, you will enhance and maintain a S3-backed graph database, designed to scale to support the metadata of millions of titles, and a variety of service agents that operate on that data. Further, you'll work in a culture that is customer obsessed, which inspires us to ensure that less-than-perfect metadata inputs are transformed into high-quality outputs, that we continually grow our metadata selection, and that our systems/services are highly-efficient in order to drive a first-class user experience. We are looking for talented software development engineers who can contribute to our world-class engineering culture. We deliver meaningful results for customers while simultaneously investing in each team member's career and overall skill set. Domain-specific skills in video can be learned on the job.

Our team works end-to-end through the Instant Video platform, and our team members have direct ownership of the customer experience. We embrace the challenges of a fast paced market and evolving technologies, paving the way to universal availability of video and pushing the envelope for streaming quality. You will be encouraged to see the big picture, be innovative, and positively impact millions of customers.
