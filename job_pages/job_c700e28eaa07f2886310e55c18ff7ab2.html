            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Are you an innovator who is already entrenched in the Hadoop space, but looking a new challenge?Come join a “start up” team and help my client build out an infrastructure for low-latency HBase and Big Data warehousing that is revolutionizing the way they manage and analyze data in a distributed environment. The platform is leveraged by hundreds of applications, all of which have their own unique capabilities and features. From low latency, to high performance, to high availability…the platform you’ll build will push the limits of real-time data analysis and business intelligence. This is a unique chance to work alongside some of the most prominent Engineers in the field, and not only be a participant, but a key contributor in the Open Source community as well. See your engineering ideas come to life in this dynamic, challenging and meritocracy-like setting where the platform vision and Open Source contributions are paramount. Challenges/projects include but are not limited to:Evaluate Hadoop projects across the ecosystem and extend and deploy them to exacting standards (high availability, big data clusters, elastic load tolerance)Dig deep into performance, scalability, capacity and reliability problems to resolve them Develop automation, installation and monitoring of Hadoop ecosystem components in our open source infrastructure stack, specifically HBase, HDFS, Map/Reduce, Yarn, Oozie, Pig, Hive, Tez, Spark and Kafka Troubleshoot and debug Hadoop ecosystem run-time issues Create application patterns for integrating internal application teams and external vendors into our infrastructure Provide developer and operations documentation to educate peer teams Qualifications:Experience building out and scaling a Hadoop-based or UNIX-hosted database infrastructure for an enterprise2+ years of experience with Hadoop infrastructure or a strong and diverse background of distributed cluster management and operations experience Experience writing software in a continuous build and automated deployment environment2+ years of Dev Ops or System Administration experience using Chef/Puppet/Ansible for system configuration, or quality shell scripting for systems management (error handling, idempotency, configuration management)In-depth knowledge of low-level Linux, UNIX networking and C system calls for high performance computing Experience with Java, Python or Ruby development (including testing with standard test frameworks and dependency management systems, knowledge of Java garbage collection fundamentals)Experience or exposure to the open source community (a well-curated blog, upstream accepted contribution or community presence<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• :Experience building out and scaling a Hadoop-based or UNIX-hosted database infrastructure for an enterprise2+ years of experience with Hadoop infrastructure or a strong and diverse background of distributed cluster management and operations experience Experience writing software in a continuous build and automated deployment environment2+ years of Dev Ops or System Administration experience using Chef/Puppet/Ansible for system configuration, or quality shell scripting for systems management (error handling, idempotency, configuration management)In-depth knowledge of low-level Linux, UNIX networking and C system calls for high performance computing Experience with Java, Python or Ruby development (including testing with standard test frameworks and dependency management systems, knowledge of Java garbage collection fundamentals)Experience or exposure to the open source community (a well-curated blog, upstream accepted contribution or community presence)</p>
