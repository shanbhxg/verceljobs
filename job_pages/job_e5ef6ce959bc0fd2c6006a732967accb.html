Since inventing and commercializing the first portable digital audio player in 1997, our focus on technological innovation and superior programming has earned us millions of subscribers around the world.

Our sites are built on a world-class e-commerce platform developed in-house at Amazon with custom libraries for Audible. The technology is similar to Spring MVC and RESTful services using state of the art build and deployment tools, automated deployment pipelines and seamless integration with apps on a variety of devices (Kindle, i OS, Android and Windows). We use amazing tools for measuring and tuning site performance (load and latency) and A/B experimentations to give the customers an experience they love. Software Development Engineers must demonstrate a bias for action, customer obsession and be focused on delivering results. We follow Agile development process and release features every sprint. In addition to the regular feature releases, this group also refreshes the bits on our production fleet (optimization of released features, security etc.) every week (at least). The group also invests on optimizing the code and our architecture. We aim to unify our Web technology stacks and steer the technology towards a mobile-first vision. We are also aiming to increase the personalization on our website by leveraging Amazon machine learning algorithms. Engineers are provided an opportunity to work closely with the business to build technology that will have the highest impact on customers.
