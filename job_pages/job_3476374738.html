Additional Information:
About Right Life Rightlife is a Health-tech organisation driven by a strong product mindset. We’ll grow through two driving forces — our highly curated content creation and our AI/ML driven technology platforms. Our content curation involves highly talented and qualified subject matter experts supported by a strong production team creating compelling content. Our tech services side is responsible for figuring out how to leverage health data to drive growth and add value to our subscribers. Right life is projected to launch in the 1st quarter of 2023 through a high decibel campaign which will make us a household brand by mid 2023. After launching and stabilising our product in India, Right Life will soon expand to international markets starting with America followed by EU/UK markets. Why this role The Product Manager is at the heart of this endeavour. Your role is to build compelling, world-class products that help us scale our business. You’ll be tasked with building bold, ambitious products that’ll dramatically increase our subscriber base. In addition, you’ll also create experiences that’ll make existing subscribers love us. And you’ll do this by owning specific areas and flows on our website, mobile apps and back-end systems. You’ll also be responsible for the product roadmap and create a strong foundation that’ll always keep Rightlife on the cutting-edge of health & wellness companies globally. We’re looking for someone with a desire to build world-class, impactful products at one of India’s most ambitious Health-tech companies. You’ll sit at the intersection of every team at Rightlife and have the autonomy and responsibility to create solutions that’ll be used every day by the world — which comprise founders, CXOs and executives at leading companies; and students at some of the most prestigious universities. Who you are You embrace bottom-up, first principles thinking — since we are pioneers, there are few replicable templates or strategies anywhere in the world that we can readily copy. The path to build a sustainable subscription business is long and challenging and you need to understand our core strengths and levers, operate within our constraints and deliver on goals. This requires deep, foundational thinking and understanding of product principles and the judgement about what is applicable and what isn’t. You are self-driven and ambitious — the success of this role is driven by what the owner makes of it. The charter is limitless and there are few obstacles (except time and bandwidth). You’ll receive guidance and direction, but it’s your responsibility to figure out a path resulting in superlative outcome. You have an independent point of view and strong beliefs, but are open to it being challenged and proven wrong. If you rely on others to get convictions of your own, chances of success are low. You are a purposeful and thoughtful communicator, being able to convince stakeholders and build consensus effectively. In an organisation filled with experienced and opinionated SMEs, leadership, and product folk, you’ll need this. Lastly, you appreciate credible content and ethical use of technology because it helps you constantly evolve as a human being and a professional. Your team You’ll work closely with other Product Managers at Rightlife, who will be your peers. All Product Managers have their core areas of responsibility, but these lines aren’t sharply defined and you’re expected to figure out and create ownership structures collaboratively. This will also include giving and receiving feedback on product features, creating a roadmap, and execution and alignment. Over time, though, it will be up to you to decide and make a case for how the Product function at Rightlife ought to grow. It’s important to note that we take pride in hands-on execution across all levels, from founders to interns. Other teams you will work with The Product Manager will work cross-functionally with practically every team at Rightlife. This includes content, production marketing, engineering, design, corporate Sales and the leadership teams. Most teams will see you as the first point of contact for their feature requests, ideas or problems, and you’ll need to establish a strong rapport with them to meet your goals. Most of your products will require a buy-in and investment of time and effort from multiple teams, and you’re expected to figure out how to get this done. You’ll report to the Chief Operating Officer, Rightlife. What a typical week may look like The week will start with a product review meeting where you share progress and impact for the previous week and what milestones you intend to achieve in subsequent weeks. You may be required to do a deep-dive on things that didn’t work, and you’ll receive feedback. You’ll also get a sense of the organisational priorities so you can make informed product decisions. You’ll also be expected to run a daily stand-up between the product and engineering teams where you’ll track execution. We follow an agile system of execution, and our sprint runs for two weeks. At the beginning of each sprint, in consultation with other PMs, you’ll set the priorities and create requirements for the engineering team. Once a fortnight, you’ll setup and run a business review meeting where we’ll run through product and business metrics across the board and track progress against our goals. In addition, you’ll have to set up a predictable cadence for generating and sharpening ideas with your team members and to solicit feedback from your manager and peers. Once a quarter, you’ll have a performance review against your tasks to access progress, along with senior leadership, and you’ll receive both praise for progress and suggested tweaks for improvement. Towards the end of the week, you might be preparing a brief session for the weekly All-Hands, talking about some upcoming product launch or drawing attention to the performance of a key feature. What you are responsible for The impact delivered by the Product Manager can be looked at across four broad areas:Outcome: Own the building and iteration of products that drive growth, engagement and retention for Rightlife. Execution: Create a regular cadence that prioritises shipping high-quality, impactful features all the way from ideation to launch. Tracking: Deeply understand what’s working and what needs attention in order to meet your goals Communication: Constantly and proactively inform the rest of the organisation and influence stakeholders to make decisions on short-term and long-term bets. Experience You have at least 7+ years of experience as a Product Manager at innovative and dynamic organisations, preferably at a consumer internet start-up. At Rightlife, your role will be central to the organisation’s execution and success, and we only seek candidates who have prior first-hand experience as a Product Manager. Skills Bias for action.
