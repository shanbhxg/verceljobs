            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>The Inventory Planning and Control (IPC) team owns Amazon's global inventory management systems: we decide what, when, where, and how much we should buy to meet Amazon's business goals and to make our customers happy. We do this for millions of items, for hundreds of product lines worth billions of dollars of inventory world-wide. Our systems are built entirely in-house, and are on the cutting edge in automated large-scale business, inventory and supply chain planning and optimization systems. IPC fosters new game-changing ideas, continuously improves, creating ever more intelligent and self-learning systems to maximize the efficiency of Amazon's inventory investment and placement decisions. IPC is unique in that we're simultaneously developing the science of supply chain planning and solving some of the toughest computational challenges at Amazon. Unlike many companies who buy existing off-the-shelf planning systems, IPC is responsible for studying, designing, and building systems to suit Amazon's needs. Our Data Scientists are at the forefront of supply chain thought leadership by working on some of the most difficult problems in the industry with some of the best research scientists and software developers in the business, shaping our roadmap to drive real impact on customer experience and on Amazon's long-term profitability. If you're interested in getting closer to the "action," IPC is the place for you.
