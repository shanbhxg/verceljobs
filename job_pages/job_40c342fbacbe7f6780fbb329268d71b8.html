            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Everyone wants to work on a cool tech stack in a cool environment. Okay, maybe not everyone, but we would guess that is true for most developers. We could frame it all up with some pretty questions that we know you would answer "yes" too, but instead let's get down to the nuts and bolts. We have an opportunity for a full stack developer that is skilled with object oriented development at a tech company. The position is a 3 month contract to hire role. The breakdown of where time will be spent in the stack and the technology that will be used is as follows:Front End (10%): React. JS (you read that right) - React experience is not required, experience with Java Script is required. Backend (60%): C#, ASP. NET, MVC, RESTful, SOAP - The team is also working to move to .NET core. Experience with web services is a must, as a bulk of the time spend on the backend will be in this space. Database (30%): SQL Server - Experience with My SQL and Postgre SQL will work. Daily duties will include designing, developing, testing, maintaining, and deploying business application software. This individual will have a hand in analyzing user needs, designing solutions, and mentoring other developers. The team is extremely collaborative and utilizes Git for version control. The work environment is very flexible - they measure productivity, not hours worked. Dress code is jeans and a shirt with a collar. The individual who is the right fit for this role will probably have 6 10 years of experience. If you have less but think you can bring the noise - reach out, we would love to talk! hello[at]godynamo[dot]c<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• o</p>
