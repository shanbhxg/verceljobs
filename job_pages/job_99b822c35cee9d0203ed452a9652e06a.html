            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Amazon. com is seeking a Research Scientist to join the Forecasting Team. We develop sophisticated algorithms that involve learning from large amounts of past data, such as prices, promotions, similar products, and a product's attributes, in order to forecast the demand of over 10 million products. These forecasts are used to automatically order more than $200 million worth of inventory weekly, establish labor plans for over 10,000 employees, and predict the overall company's financial performance. The work is complex and important to Amazon. The better our forecasts, the more we can lower prices for customers and offer in-stock selection. You will have an opportunity to work on a complex mathematical problem, with a large element of unpredictability. You will develop new sophisticated algorithms and improve existing approaches based on modern statistical, machine learning, and data mining methods to impact the core business of Amazon. You are an individual with outstanding analytical abilities, excellent communication skills, and are comfortable working with technical teams and systems. You will be responsible for researching, experimenting, and analyzing forecasting strategies and mathematical models. You will also be prototyping the implementations. Key responsibilities: * Build mathematical models to represent demand forecasting at various levels. * Prototype these models by using high-level modeling languages such as MATLAB or R, or in software languages such as Python. A software team will be working with you to transform prototypes into production. * Create, enhance, and maintain technical documentation, and present to other Scientists. In order to perform the above responsibilities well, you also need to * Gather data required for analysis and mathematical model building by writing ad-hoc scripts and database queries in a Hadoop environment. * Interact with software and business groups to develop an understanding of their business requirements and operational processes. Basic Qualifications * Ph. D. in Machine Learning, Data Mining, Statistics, Applied Mathematics, or a related field and 2 years of of industry experience, or a Master's degree in Machine Learning, Data Mining, Statistics, Applied Mathematics or a related field and 4 or more years of industry experience. * 3+ years experience in machine learning with domain knowledge and experience in the following areas: data-driven statistical modeling, discriminative methods, feature extraction and analysis, supervised learning. * Fluency in a high-level modeling language such as MATLAB or R. * 1+ years experience with data extraction and analysis. Preferred Qualifications * Superior verbal and written communication skills. * Experience with large data sets (10 million+ rows). * A natural curiosity and desire to learn. * Ability to convey rigorous mathematical concepts and considerations to non-experts. * Ability to distill problem definitions, models, and constraints from informal business. requirements; and to deal with ambiguity and competing objectives. * Software development skills. * Knowledge of relational databases (SQL). * Applied experience building/evaluating predictive models is desirable. * Distributed programming experience is highly recommended. Experience in Python is helpful.
