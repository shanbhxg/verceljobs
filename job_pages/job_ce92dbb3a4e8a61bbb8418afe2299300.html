            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>This position is for a senior support desk specialist at Complete Technology Solutions (CTS). The primary focus of this position will be to troubleshoot client issues with hardware and/or software on workstations, servers and networking equipment. The main forms of communication with clients are over the phone and through email. No on-site work is required for this position. The support desk team works out of our office near Dry Creek and I-25. Our help desk hours are from 7am to 5pm; in this position you would be starting at 8am (subject to change). Our support team works in a bull pen style office space. There are no cubicles. This allows for open communication and collaboration between team members. Every member of our support desk team has 3 monitors at their desk - if you can use more we’ll get you more! CTS supports thousands of users in multiple states. We are primarily focused on supporting small to medium sized businesses. We have long term contracts with all of our clients that we support so you will get to know these people when they call in for troubleshooting – it will not be a random consumer who calls in for help. Our support team handles all reactive issues; we do not have a tier system. This means that the support desk personnel are the experts. If there are issues with line of business software that is out of our expertise/knowledge, we do have the ability to call the software vendor to get help on the problem. Even with the support from a vendor, all issue resolution begins and ends with the support desk team. They are the most technically knowledgeable people at CTS. The support team is able to triage all incoming issues and troubleshoot accordingly based on urgency, severity, and business impact. We use a ticketing system at CTS. All work done by the support team must be thoroughly documented in our ticketing system which captures time per ticket as well (automatically while the ticket is open). There are four ways a ticket gets opened: 1) a client calls in so the support desk team documents the issue in a ticket 2) a client emails an issue in so the system creates a ticket automatically 3) our remote monitoring and management tool creates a ticket automatically 4) other teams within CTS may submit tickets – onsite teams for example. Since you will be typing a lot, it’d be beneficial if you were excellent at typing quickly on a keyboard. Since our clients will be seeing what you type in a ticket, it would be great if you wrote well and with proper grammar. We like our ticket count to be in the single digits at all times. In order to accomplish this, the support team must be able to resolve issues quickly – 10 minutes or less is preferable. This also means that the support team should find and fix the root cause of an issue so that the problem does not occur again. Here are some examples of what we help our clients with:Changing network configurations as needed on switches, routers, firewalls, and wireless access points Network connectivity Remote access Internet and phone outages Email setup and troubleshooting Installing and setting up software User administration and helping users log in Solving complex issues with line of business applications Assisting clients with standard user issues such as logging in, printing, scanning, and email Diagnosing hardware and software problems Recovering lost or deleted files Virus and malware remediation Assisting vendors with network and/or software integration issues Troubleshooting drivers for line of business specific peripherals Well, if you’ve made it this far and are still interested in the position, we’d like you to take a quick online test that will help us get to know you. Please click here to take the test. Once you've taken the test, please don't forget to apply for the position here on Dice. Also, please keep reading because there's more info below! Since the support desk team works to troubleshoot issues remotely, they need to have the skills to be able to walk clients through troubleshooting issues that they cannot see. For example, walking a client through: rebooting a switch, logging in to a server that we cannot connect to and rebooting it, pinging a computer on the network, etc. You may be wondering how we connect in to the various client machines that we support. As quickly mentioned in the previous section, we use a Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tool that allows us quick access to any machine that we manage. You do not need to have the user you are supporting download anything and get you connected; you will have immediate access. The RMM tool that is used has a wealth of information about each machine managed and also controls patch management, software updates, anti-virus, backups, etc. It’s your all-in-one support tool and what you will be spending the most time using to support the assets we manage. At CTS we have the following six values: 1) enjoy life, 2) customers first, 3) today not tomorrow, 4) correct the first time, 5) respect for team and customers, 6) process and procedures. Please send an email to “jobs@systemconfidence. com” with what each of the six values means to you. Our ideal candidate should: be kind, exhibit patience, sincerely want to help people, and be a great problem solver. The support team creates and updates knowledgebase articles and how-to documents (we use an online tool for this). This way, the knowledge of how to do certain things can be shared with team members and with clients. The expectation is that if there is no existing how-to for something that you’ve ‘figured out’ or learned, that you would create the how-to. CTS is a fast growing business with a laid back and fun work environment. The office is stocked with free soft/energy drinks and snacks. Management often buys lunch for everyone. Cell phones are provided by CTS for business and personal use. The clothing attire is casual - jeans and polo shirts. Polo shirts with the company logo are provided by CTS. This salaried position includes benefits, paid holidays and paid vacation.
