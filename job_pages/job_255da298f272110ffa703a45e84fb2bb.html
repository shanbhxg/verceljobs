We provide our client companies with permanent, temporary, and temporary-to-permanent staffing. The Seattle Tech market is blowing up (and has been for some time). I'm working with multiple brand name (and start up) clients in the Greater Seattle Area who are looking for Senior Software Development Engineers. My clients (Consumer products, web, services, mobile, Big Data, e Commerce, etc.) are paying top dollar to have a crack at the best talent the Seattle market has to offer. Are you stuck in a rut? Hate your commute? Or, maybe you're happy with your current job, but just want to dip your toes in the water and see what else is out there? Perhaps you currently live/work in another market and are considering a move to Seattle? Most of my clients offer relocation assistance, and in some cases, full relocation packages. If you're a Senior Software Engineer with considerable depth in C/C++ OR Java OR Objective-C OR Node. js OR Java Script OR Scala OR C# (Ideally fluent in numerous development languages and platforms), I'm interested in getting to know YOU - YOUR likes/dislikes, YOUR compensation expectations, YOUR ideal work environment, YOUR desired career trajectory, YOUR ideal commute, etc. Things I won't do:SPAM your resume. When you work with me, I'll only present you to client opportunities after we've had a chance to discuss in full detail and you've given me the green light to represent you. Betray your trust. Confidentiality is the name of the game. Having worked in this for many years, I understand the intricacies surrounding job changes. Set you up to fail. While it's difficult for me to determine the ultimate outcome of various interview scenarios, I will do my best to be honest with you regarding your likelihood of advancing to the offer stage with a particular client. I work closely with my clients to gain a deep understanding of what works and doesn't work for their environment and do my best to calibrate to their hiring bar. Bottom line, I won't present you to my clients if I don't think the match is strong. Interested candidates - please select "apply now" and send us an updated resume and let's set up a time to talk!Greg Browning, Senior Account Manager / Senior Technical Recruiter Keywords:C, C++, Java, Objective-C, i OS, Android, C#, Web Services, Mobile, Gaming, Node. js, Java Script, Scal<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• a</p>
