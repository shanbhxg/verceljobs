            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>The Mechanical Engineer will provide epidemiological trend- and risk-analysis services, accident- and combat-incident investigation services, research and testing services, material testing services, and on-site management in support of the Survival Analysis Division of the USAARL, which supports the MRMC Joint Trauma Analysis and Prevention of Injury in Combat (JTAPIC) program. Work may be complex, requiring critical thinking combined with independent judgment. DUTIES INCLUDE: Analyze aviation, mounted and dismounted combat and peacetime incidents and injuries (Killed in Action [KIA] and Wounded in Action [WIA]). To plan and execute both retrospective and prospective investigations after forming hypotheses regarding WIA and KIA injury and protection mechanisms. Develop and report responses to various RFI's transmitted by the primary MRMC JTAPIC Program office. Conduct trend and risk analyses relating to combat injuries and accidents, including data retrieval, extraction, clean-up, processing, analysis, and publication/presentation of results. Perform individual event analyses, live fire crosswalks, and overall trend analyses for the above, as well as for other events, as may be required. Develop and present actionable, medically-based intelligence derived from the above analyses regarding potential upgrades/changes in materiel and techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTP). Anticipate participation in at least three ground and six aviation mishaps (to include on-site evaluation, which may include OCONUS travel) per year. Identify potential data-sharing partners; develop both organizational and personal relationships to assist in formalizing data-sharing agreements between USAARL and other operational data resources to improve the robustness and accuracy of provided analyses. Establish in-house collaboration with members of other divisions within USAARL, in order to develop and maintain connectivity between other lab divisions/branches, remote resources, and MRMC resources. Provide services related to the preparation of draft reports, presentations, and other documentation on analysis progress and findings, which will be distributed, presented, and/or discussed within the laboratory and/or at other external forums. Complete quarterly research progress reports, which will include trend analyses, and briefing material. Generate and maintain detailed analyses, records, related summaries, and reports, all of which remain the intellectual-, as well as the physical-property of USAARL (including the source data). In accordance with the new USAARL competency management alignment, JTAPIC staff will be integrated into the functions of the Survival Analysis Division, including writer/editor support within the USAARL Science Information Center. Deliverables associated with tasks shall be issued at the task order level. REQUIREMENTS: Required Experience / Qualifications: BS in Mechanical Engineering or related discipline A minimum of 3 years of personal experience / expertise in conducting combat and/or accident investigations, focused on vehicle and personal protective systems performance. Expertise in mechanical engineering and materials testing, to include at least two years of work experience in data analysis and data acquisition, including scientific software packages such as MATLAB. Expertise in the capabilities and operation of aviation and combat vehicles (i. e., all US Army aviation platforms, MRAP, Stryker, Bradley, and HMMWV), to include incumbent PPE and vehicle protection systems and capabilities, performance, and potential countermeasures to address protection systems shortfalls. Possess a documented knowledge of human anatomy and physiology, especially A&P aspects of injury mechanisms. Expertise in statistical analysis, to include past performance of trend analyses and assessment of risk from various hazards, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the vehicle platform and occupant (college transcripts and/or journal publications). Correlation of multi-disciplinary statistical analyses focused on understanding the proficiencies and deficiencies of protective equipment within the physiological cascade of wounding events. Experience in relational database development, management, and data packaging algorithms; capable of accessing and utilizing external data resources, and experience in data retrieval, extraction, clean-up, processing, and analysis. Experience with investigations utilizing human data, including compliance with accepted scientific, security and human-use rules, regulations, and guidelines, particularly in the military environment. Ability to comply with all specified guidelines regarding safety, security, standard operating procedures, written protocols, technical manuals, and procurement of supplies/equipment as per USAARL regulations. Expertise in written and oral communications, as well as interpersonal relations, to include at least five years of work experience using desktop publishing hardware and software to create materials for internal reviews and external presentation. Capable of managing all operations in compliance with US Government security, human use, and information technology practices. Capable of Department of the Army (DA) document- and records-management, meeting all requirements of existing Army Records Information Management System (ARIMS) specifications. Must be able to work independently with minimal direction. Required Certification: Must be current in Defense Level II Acquisition Certification, or be able to obtain currency within 2 years. TRAVEL: May be required, on written authority of the Laboratory Commander, to fly on military aircraft or ride in military vehicles in the official conduct of travel and duties of the position.
