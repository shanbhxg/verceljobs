Microsoft Research is looking for a strong web/client tooling and testing engineer to advance our AI effort in photography. Join us to for creating cutting-edge consumer mobile apps utilizing machine learning! We have published a computer vision i OS app called "Microsoft Pix" (http://gizmodo. com/microsoft-made-the-easiest-photo-app-in-the-universe-1784378013). It is full with advanced algorithms and machine learning research. You will help us: - Build web and client tools that process/visualize the computer vision data - Improve state of the art computer vision research by using those tools - Verify Microsoft Pix app scenarios (automatically, and manually).What you need to bring to the table: - Be a strong team player, great communicator and passionate about Microsoft Pix or photography - Strong .NET skills - Full stack web development on Azure (e. g., Can you create a secure Azure web app with a Type Script+React client side?) - Tinkering capabilities (e. g., Can you use Power Shell/Perl?) - Familiarity with Azure offerings and ability to use them (e. g., How would you sanitize and backup a blob periodically?) - Great attention to details and strong passion for generating high quality code - Machine learning experience and/or mobile experience are strong pluses, but are not required. Story Behind the Need – Business Group & Key Projects Our team is a part of the MSFT TNR (Research Team) team. We focus on Mobile based apps, focus on Microsoft PIX App. To take better photos than stock i Phone app, based on the algorithm of the app. This App also collects the data to use (if end user opps in) Need someone to create a Web based and client based tool to analyze the raw data collected. Part of the role is to help run the test patch. Will organize and present findings to research team. Skill- set most important going forward: (stack ranked) Tooling – create tools, followed Test, Mobile App experience Measurable Performance: Agile team, define tasks, this person will be expected to remain to the schedule within the outlined timelines. Also expected to show their motivation/passion of creating a tool to help the team, and reflect passion of quality. Should see experience End to End tool design Day to Day tasks/responsibility: - Build web and client tools that process/visualize the computer vision data - Improve state of the art computer vision research by using those tools - Verify Microsoft Pix app scenarios (automatically, and manually). - Participate in morning SCRUM meetings - Work closely with the Senior Developers to define projects and where support is needed - Spend up to an hour each day for testing - Interact with the tool and suggest finding of 1 or 2 of the team Candidate Requirements Top 3 must-have hard skills1 Strong .NET skills- Full stack web development on Azure (e. g., Can you create a secure Azure web app with a Type Script+React client side?)2 Tinkering capabilities (e. g., Can you use Power Shell/Perl?)3 Machine learning experience and/or mobile experience are strong pluses, but are not required. Experience: familiar with Microsoft tool set, Web development, database, SDTE role or within Microsoft or another company. Attention to detail due to testing responsibility Microsoft Experience = Nice to have Degree/Certification = preferred Computer Science as a major, but Experience is top priorit<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• y</p>
