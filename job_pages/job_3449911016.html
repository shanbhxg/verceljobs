Work Location: Bengaluru and Pune About Hevo Every company today wants to leverage cutting-edge technology - Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Predictive Analytics - to make smarter business decisions. Data is the foundational block on top of which these advanced techniques can be applied. However, business users in every company struggle to get access to accurate and reliable data. Data resides fragmented across the 100s of business software that businesses use. The majority of the data operators’ time is spent manually consolidating data and too little in deriving insights. If this ‘collection’ can be automated, it can lead to making business decisions faster, unlocking exponential growth, and delivering a superior experience to customers. At Hevo, our mission is to enable every company to be data-driven. We started on this journey 4 years back and as the first step in this direction, we built our first product – “Data Pipeline” or simply “Pipeline”.Hevo Pipeline is a no-code platform that helps companies to connect all their sources of data within the company to get a unified view of their business. The platform offers integrations with 100+ data sources such as Databases, Saa S applications, Advertising Channels, etc. Today, we enable 1000+ companies across 40+ countries to be more data-driven. Nearly 97% of users within any company are non-technical users and our aim is to make the technology so simple that anyone should be able to solve their data problems and not be limited due to their lack of technical skills.
