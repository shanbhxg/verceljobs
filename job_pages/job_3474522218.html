About the Company Rusk Media is building the future of entertainment. We are on a mission to revolutionize how entertainment is consumed among the 12-34 audience across the globe. The vision to embark on this journey arose from a conversation with a sponsor during a college fest at IIT Delhi, where in the middle of all the “deliverable checklist” conversations came an understanding that current day advertising is a push business happening at the cost of entertainment. There just had to be a way to make both work, and 7 years later, we, at Rusk with our customer-first mindset and branded content we’ve delivered value to advertisers across the nations’ length. We deliver fiction entertainment via our products across the advertiser led (AVOD / free content) and subscriber led (SVOD / OTT) landscape.
