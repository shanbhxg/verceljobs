The ideal candidate loves being the person who interfaces between the development team and the server maintenance/hosting team, who understands technology deeply both at the server level and at the development level, understands where the gaps often are between these two, and is excited about filling those gaps and taking pro-active steps to prevent web application emergencies from ever happening. This person is deeply familiar with a variety of monitoring solutions (both server and web application), understands New Relic in depth, and is able to set up, configure and use these tools to identify potential gaps and stop them from ever becoming an issue. The TPM acts as a project management technical lead and business analysis subject matter expert and is responsible for working with business functional areas to deliver technical solutions in the form of new and enhanced web application functionality. The TPM manages all phases of service delivery including: analysis and design, configuration and build, testing and training, and deployment of solutions and will be accountable for all aspects of deployment and technical operations including all project resources (including partners/subcontractors), project planning, scheduling, risk management, scope management, internal and external communications, status reporting, and resource management (internal and partners). This person must be able to coordinate well between a variety of vendors and technical experts and enjoy that experience. This is not a network / infrastructure management position except as those relate to the web applications that relies on to operation. Person to tackle our organization's toughest technology problems, drive operational excellence, manage our IT development portfolio and team, and work together with senior management to execute on the organization's vision. You are an excellent communicator, able to eliminate jargon when necessary, yet able to dive deep into technical details when working with development staff. You take complete ownership of projects and treat any failure as a personal one to ensure that no stone is left unturned.

You are skillful and experienced at managing your team to ensure a healthy work culture and environment. You insist on the highest standards in order to identify, recruit, and retain the best talent. You are passionate about everything no one else wants to be responsible for. Many people love server maintenance, others love writing code, but you are excited about the place where these two meet; finding any small detail, whether code, software or data related that could one day become a bigger issue, and taking action to correct course before anyone else has even noticed. You care about the deployment process, continuous integration, quality control - some people might call this role 'Application Infrastructure Manager'; others call it Dev Ops Manager; either way, you care about the application infrastructure, environment, data, code and processes. You want to make sure that all the important components of web application management are addressed and addressed thoroughly, systematically and cleanly - even if no one else notices or cares. The things that could one day start becoming an issue after the other guys on the team have completed their work (coding, testing, deployment, server maintenance) are what get you exited; post deployment, sustainability, scalability, performance, etc. You love tools like New Relic, JMeter and Google Analytics, and have a strong desire to automate information delivery, especially about potential issues or what could later become an issue<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• </p>
