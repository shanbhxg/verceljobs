            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Position Overview The Conservation Biology Institute (CBI) is a growing non-profit organization, dedicated to providing scientific and technical expertise to support the conservation and recovery of biological diversity. The spatial data manager will be responsible for coordination and maintenance of all spatial data for the organization, which relies heavily on GIS data for nearly all projects. This includes managing a large collection of project-related data internal to the organization as well as curating a large and growing spatial data library as part of our online Data Basin platform (databasin. org). Working in a team environment, the spatial data manager will lead the development and implementation of geographic data management policies and procedures for the organization (e. g., metadata standards, file management, and data QA/QC) and support other science and technical staff in data management and coordination. This position requires someone who is highly detail-oriented and passionate about geospatial data and documentation.

For extra credit, try this (in addition to submitting a cover letter and resume):• We work in a multi-user environment wherein staff on the same project currently share spatial datasets (GDB feature classes, net CDF files, etc.) by copying/pasting to a file server. This results in problems with version control, schema locks, redundancy, permissions etc. Propose an alternative solution for sharing/managing data in a multiuser environment and be specific as to the types of technology, software packages and DBMSs you might use to implement the solution (schematics encouraged).Please send materials in your cover letter to Pamela Frost, Vice President & Chief Operations Officer when applying to this position.
