            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Uber has become an integral part of people’s lives and it is critical that the systems that power the platform are always available to everyone in the world. Uber continues to expand into new cities and its growth and popularity presents interesting challenges for matching developer agility with the scale and complexity of its infrastructure. We are looking for engineers that are able to apply the principles and discipline of robust distributed systems to solve infrastructure challenges, while enhancing developer productivity and maintaining operational simplicity. Our systems span physical data centers and cloud providers. You will be part of a team of engineers with a healthy mix of systems and software engineering skills, executing in a fast paced environment. If you love working on software products that touch the physical world and want some serious experience under exponential growth conditions, this is the role for you. A Site Reliability Engineer is a Software Engineer with strong systems and operational skills in one or more functional domains, where the domain may range from Databases to Networking. Most importantly, they have a passion for designing and maintaining highly reliable systems. Empirically, strong engineers with this skillset and passion tend to be a rare breed. As a member of Storage SRE you’ll be responsible for SQL and No SQL database management systems, data caching, queuing and distributed file systems. You will be building cluster management and automation tools which will enable you to provide infrastructure components as a service for fellow product engineers. Petabytes of data, self healing and automatic scaling are just a few of the challenges you will be presented with. We are not about operations, we are building the systems and tooling that make operations unnecessary. SRE Activities: Automation.
