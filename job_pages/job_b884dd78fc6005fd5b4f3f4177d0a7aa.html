They are looking for the Practice Lead for their Secure Coding and Code Review consulting practice. This role provides a unique opportunity to change the way code is written and deployed securely. Moving beyond existing static analysis tools and code review techniques, you will shape the way the industry secures code in a Continuous Deployment world. The compensation here will be very strong. If you are the right person for the job, the compensation package will get figured out. Profit sharing, equity and good benefits can also be expected.

You'll mentor and lead code review engineers while at the same time engaging the industry through speaking and writing. You'll participate in the most strategic customer engagements, but you'll still have plenty of time to think, do research, allocate R&D funds, and innovate. To succeed, you'll need to have existing credibility in the developer community (extensive Git Hub code, open source contributions, evangelism through speaking / writing). You'll need deep coding experience in web technologies (OO languages, Java Script libraries), and strong knowledge of software testing approaches (TDD, Dynamic Testing, etc.).You'll need to have experience being a senior technical advisor and very strong interpersonal consulting skills. 50% travel is likely, with most of it being East and West Coast of the US.
