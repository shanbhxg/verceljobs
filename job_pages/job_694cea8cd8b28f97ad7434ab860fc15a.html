            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Uber’s Marketplace is the network of drivers transporting people, pets, food and packages. To make our Marketplace system more efficient and more intelligent, we need to extract deep and timely insights from our carefully curated data. We also have to make the insights easily accessible for both people and machines to consume in realtime. Big data is about volume, variety and velocity. Our business is growing very fast, so is our data volume. Uber’s foray into initiatives such as uber RUSH (package delivery) and uber EATS (food delivery) brings us variety. Our team is focused on processing this data in realtime and feed the intelligence gathered via various algorithms back into the runtime dispatch systems which brings in the velocity. Such demands present a unique opportunity for us to build a world-class realtime data processing platform that pushes Uber's marketplace logistic platform to the next level. Uber’s stream processing presentation at QCon provides a flavor of the technical architecture and challenges addressed by the team. What you’ll be doing: You will focus on bringing high impact for a real world business that affects millions of drivers and riders by working alongside product and data science in applications such as dynamic pricing (surge pricing, upfront pricing), intelligent dispatching (matching algorithms), and supply positioning (optimal positioning of drivers in anticipation of demand patterns). The goal of these systems is to dramatically lower cost & ETAs for riders, increase revenue for driver partners, improve the overall efficiency and utilization of Uber’s fleet of supply, and enable products in entirely new marketplaces. You get to work on every component of the data pipeline including data collection, aggregation and indexing, analytics including predictions, visualization, and querying. You get to experiment, productize, and contribute to open source technologies when building your systems What we’re looking for: You intend to go deep on a subject and enjoy learning what’s necessary to get the job done. You love coding, debugging and attacking hard problems. You have a strong engineering background, and ideally have built real distributed data systems. You have good understanding of distributed systems, in theory and in practice. For example you intimately know the trade-offs of different sharding and replication strategies; you can reason about data consistency in a distributed environment; and you know some consensus algorithms and at least tried studying Paxos. You will dive into a variety of cutting edge technologies, such as distributed logging as in Apache Kafka, stream processing as in Apache Storm and Apache Samza, large-scale data processing as in Apache Spark, distributed indexing as in Elastic Search, distributed aggregation and querying as in Facebook Scuba and Metamarkets Druid, and data intensive real time services built using Java/Scala/Python/Go based frameworks. You're a great communicator, and you follow things through -- you could be interacting with every other product development team within Uber. Bonus points if you: Are familiar with either stats, signal processing, or machine learning algorithms. Have deep production experience with large-scale data processing platforms, such as Hadoop or Spark. Are familiar with interactive data visualization techniques. Perks Employees are given Uber credits every month. The rare opportunity to change the world such that everyone around you is using the product you built. We’re not just another social web app, we’re moving real people and assets and reinventing transportation and logistics globally. Sharp, motivated co-workers in a fun office environment. Benefits (U. S.) 401(k) plan, gym reimbursement, nine paid company holidays. Full medical/dental/vision package to fit your needs. Unlimited vacation policy; work hard and take time when you need it.
