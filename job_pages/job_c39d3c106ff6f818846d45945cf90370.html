            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>If you are a committed, creative professional and are passionate about making a lasting difference for children, the world's leading children's rights organization would like to hear from you. For 70 years, UNICEF has been working on the ground in 190 countries and territories to promote children's survival, protection and development. The world's largest provider of vaccines for developing countries, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, good water and sanitation, quality basic education for all boys and girls, and the protection of children from violence, exploitation, and AIDS. UNICEF is funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of individuals, businesses, foundations and governments. Background The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programs, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children's rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. In line with the new ICT Strategy initiated in 2015, it is planned to reorganize the central ICT function at NYHQ into four main functional areas: 1) Business Relationships Management 2) Strategy, Risk Management and Governance; 3) A Solutions Centre; and 4) a Platform Delivery group. This ICT organizational structure is expected to be implemented in early 2017 and is designed to ensure synergies as per best practices in the industry, with increased emphasis on agility and user satisfaction.
