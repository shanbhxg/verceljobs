Work out of our Colorado Springs, CO or Edison, NJ office when not traveling.

(XTIVIA understands family and work balance. Sometime you have to work off hours to finish a project or when on call...we try to compensate you for that). For those that aspire to this calling, that prove themselves to be detailed oriented, responsive, professional, master communicators, and that can work without supervision... remind us to share with you about the opportunity of working remotely from home a couple of days a week…Compensation will depend on years’ experience.
