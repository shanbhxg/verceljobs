Planning and organization—You can learn the technical details of a feature, but think through content from a user perspective when planning what to write. Meet deadlines with required deliverables. Problem solving skills—You have strong critical-thinking skills and use them to ensure that you are providing just the information our users need to solve their network security problems. Attention to detail—You can edit your work to ensure the grammatical, stylistic, and technical accuracy demanded of enterprise-level documentation. Initiative—You’re not afraid to propose changes to improve process and quality to improve the customer experience.
