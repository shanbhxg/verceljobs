            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Changing the world is all in a day's work at Apple. If you love innovation, here's your chance to make a career of it. You'll work hard. But the job comes with more than a few perks. In this highly visible role as a core team member in our advanced CAD Group, you will enhance your career working on state of the art designs. Youll utilize your hands on experience in flow graph parallelization, automation, compute and EDA licensing resource allocation, to develop/define & refine scalable methodologies to enable circuit designer to efficiently drive thousands of jobs to deliver transistor level analysis deliverables for different IP and Meagcells targeted for parallel projects. You will acquire breath of knowledge across multiple disciplines and process nodes that include but not limited to transistor level extraction, timing analysis, static/dynamic IR analysis and simulations, power EM analysis, signal EM analysis, logic equivalency check (LEC) and signoff. Key Qualifications: Typically requires 5 15 years of experience in the following areas: Proven track record in implementing, maintaining and deploying dependency based flows using Make or Flow Tracer Proven scripting expertise in, Tcl or Perl for wide deployment across different geographic location and groups. Host live debugging session at short notice and be able to focus on the short term objectives without losing sight of long-term value of developing preventive measures Solid background in utilizing unix shell to improve daily productivity Solid exposure in revision control, license management and parallel compute (LSF, Sun Grid or NC)Description: Primary responsibilities include development and integration of multiple point flows into single graphical make context; be the first line of support (setting up inputs and trouble shooting output) for various point flows and assist in removing hardware or software obstacles that jeopardize schedules; identify opportunities to improve and streamlining IP deliverable turn around time. You will work closely with various design groups (Custom Digital/Analog/Mixed-Signal) on their requirements for various pre/post layout flows for each project. You will also work closely with various point flow expert to qualify internal CAD flow and external vendor tool. Education: MSEE or BSEE or equivalent. Additional Requirements: Layout, extraction, and simulation Flow regressions Circuit and physical design knowledge Power analysis Timing analysis Apple is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer that is committed to inclusion and diversity. We also take affirmative action to offer employment and advancement opportunities to all applicants, including minorities, women, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• : Typically requires 5 15 years of experience in the following areas: Proven track record in implementing, maintaining and deploying dependency based flows using Make or Flow Tracer Proven scripting expertise in, Tcl or Perl for wide deployment across different geographic location and groups<br>• Host live debugging session at short notice and be able to focus on the short term objectives without losing sight of long-term value of developing preventive measures Solid background in utilizing unix shell to improve daily productivity Solid exposure in revision control, license management and parallel compute (LSF, Sun Grid or NC)Description: Primary responsibilities include development and integration of multiple point flows into single graphical make context; be the first line of support (setting up inputs and trouble shooting output) for various point flows and assist in removing hardware or software obstacles that jeopardize schedules; identify opportunities to improve and streamlining IP deliverable turn around time<br>• You will work closely with various design groups (Custom Digital/Analog/Mixed-Signal) on their requirements for various pre/post layout flows for each project<br>• You will also work closely with various point flow expert to qualify internal CAD flow and external vendor tool<br>• Education: MSEE or BSEE or equivalent<br>• Additional Requirements: Layout, extraction, and simulation Flow regressions Circuit and physical design knowledge Power analysis Timing analysis Apple is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer that is committed to inclusion and diversity<br>• We also take affirmative action to offer employment and advancement opportunities to all applicants, including minorities, women, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities</p>
