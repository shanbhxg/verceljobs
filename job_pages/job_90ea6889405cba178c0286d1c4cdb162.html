            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>The AV (Amazon Video) Content Discovery Platform team is looking for high energy and experienced engineers to help us build the future of digital video streaming services. Our team is at the heart of the AV customer journey to find movies and TV shows to watch with ownership of the Home Page, Browse, and Search APIs. Practically every single AV session across all devices begins with a call to the home page API to fetch a personalized, ready to render view of the movies and TV shows most likely to be of interest to the customer. Underneath the covers, the best Movie and TV choices for the customer are identified amongst thousands of contenders, with massive parallelization to support complex algorithms and business rules to be applied with split second efficiency. Content Discovery Platform sits at the head of the stage, orchestrating the entire operation. These APIs are Tier-1 systems that must be highly available, low latency despite enormous complexity and scale. The right candidate will have experience designing, building and operating Tier-1 software systems at comparable scale. The APIs are used by a variety of devices with different capabilities--from 2010 smart TVs to the latest Fire TV. The API design must support a lot of flexibility across clients while still standardizing common functionality. Experience with API design for broad use applications is a distinct plus. The central nature of this team means high visibility, and plenty of opportunities to grow and learn. As a member of the Content Discovery Platform team you will have the opportunity to collaborate with senior engineers from client and personalization teams, understanding and anticipating their needs from our platforms, and influencing complex, multifaceted, cross-system designs. We're a high energy, fast growth business excited to have the opportunity to shape how video is consumed for years to come. In addition to a digital video streaming service, we also operate as an original content production house with hits like Transparent and Mozart In the Jungle already under our belt. The service is available in US, UK, Germany and Japan on dozens of tablets, phones, game consoles, smart TVs and, of course, on the humble browser at www. amazon. com/aiv . If you are interested, please reach out, we'd love to talk to you.
