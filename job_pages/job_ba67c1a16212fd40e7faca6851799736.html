            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Hi, Greetings :)Here is a requirement I am currently working on. If you or any one you know is a good match for this position and is looking for a project,Please go through the description below and if interested; respond with a copy of word formatted resume. Deep Learning Specialist Santa Clara or Sunnyvale CA THE ROLE:In collaboration with 1-2 other team members, investigate possibility of application of deep learningusing RNN with LSTM to predict repeatable patterns in normal log streams. Propose scalablearchitecture for supporting feature vectors which represent input log lines of ordered charactersequences into the network input layer. Working from existing Python code, develop scalable Scala codefor this which can run in parallel on Spark. Detect significant deviations from the normal patterns. Thiswould be an experimental feature only as we would need GPU processors to produce viableperformance on deep neural networks due to the heavy matrix computations and derivatives involved. MUST HAVE:- Solid knowledge about deep learning architectures, loss functions, optimizer and the theories- Recurrent neural network, Convolutional neural network, Auto encoders- Software stack: Spark, Python, Theano or Tensorflow- Basic statistical knowledge NICE TO HAVE:- Published research paper in the topic- Applying deep learning in embedded environment- Work on custom optimizer or loss function- Natural Language Processing knowledge or prior working experience in unstructured log processing - Experience on deep learning on cluster WE WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU ARE:- An able communicator,- Can discuss complex topics and educate project team members- A great team player and work effectively in with diverse project teams.
