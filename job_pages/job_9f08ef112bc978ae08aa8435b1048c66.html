Strong Java Script experience is required and to be a fit for this mobile role as opposed to a standard Front End Engineer they should have an interest in mobile, responsive applications/web design. Think of how to see a page on multiple devices and have it be fluid (take for example looking at the facebook application on your phone and then on the computer).
