About XONAI The end of Moore's law, coupled with the fast-growing requirements for more compute power in a data-driven world, is shifting the industry into a hardware-centric future to realize cost-efficient compute infrastructure. We believe data-driven organizations can accelerate the pace of innovation and unlock faster time to value when powered by a solution designed to move established data infrastructure towards the ideal deployment, without requiring monitoring, observability, or configuration changes. About this role: As a Senior Software Engineer for this role, you will collaborate with the founding team to expand the integration of our data processing acceleration technology with Apache Spark to drive new optimizations and broader API coverage. Your contributions to our core product will significantly impact adoption of our platform and value delivered to data engineers activating our platform in their cloud infrastructure. Join us in building a cutting edge solution for the cloud to realize cost-effective data infrastructure at scale and with unparalleled flexibility. What you will bring: Strong Java and Scala programming skills. Experience with JVM profiling and debugging tools. An understanding of data processing technologies (i. e. Spark, Kafka, Parquet, Avro).Strong grasp of computer science fundamentals such as algorithms and data structures. Ability to write, test and deploy production code driven by modern software engineering practices. Critical thinking and ability to work independently without direct supervision. Strong analytical and excellent problem solving skills. What you will do: Accelerate Apache Spark data processing performance by offloading query compilation to our domain-specific compiler. Design and implement new data processing optimizations at query plan level. Optimize internal processes that contribute to query time (I/O, serialization, data sources).Diligently test new optimizations and assess their impact on benchmarks. Work with the internals of leading open-source software for big data analytics as part of our core product for the cloud. Collaborate with team members to drive new innovations on big data processing lying at the intersection of big data and compiler technologies. Nice-To-Haves: Experience with the internals of data processing frameworks (Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Apache Arrow, etc).Experience with query processing and optimization. Experience with container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes, etc).Understanding of data storage formats and processing internals (Parquet, Delta, ORC, Avro, etc).Hands-on experience with public cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure).Entrepreneurial spirit and previous experience in early stage start-ups. Exposure to Data Science and Machine Learning environments. What we offer: Dedicated Team. Work with an amazing team exploring compiler and big data technologies to build the next-generation solution for data infrastructure at scale. Flexible Location. Work where you feel most productive, either fully remote or at any coworking office space of your convenience. Competitive Compensation. We offer strong compensation upfront, aligned with a starting equity package, progressive compensation plan and employee referral program. Amazing Benefits. In order to attract and retain the best talent, we offer medical insurance, a dental, audio and visual cash plan, as well as a company pension.
