We place candidates direct hire, contract to hire and on long term contracts. Our placements are mostly Software Developers, Analysts, System Adminstrators and Engineers. The compensation is salary plus commissions plus bonuses. The target income is $110,000 but there is no cap on commissions so it could be much more than that!
