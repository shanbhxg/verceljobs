            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Title:- Ruby on Rails Mode of interview: Phone and skype Duration: 6Lead Engineers report to one of our Engineering Managers, and work closely with business stakeholders to define and execute requirements. Our software engineering team: Our engineering squads work right alongside our teams in operations, analytics, accounting, marketing, and even recruiting. We are expected not just to be the experts in technology, but to be able to fully understand what we are trying to build as a company-­‐-­‐then make it possible. Both inside and outside engineering, we drive each other to learn more and to build better. This makes for a culture and passion made from individuals working together, not a top-­‐down initiative. We have earnest conversations about technology, structures and process, and the best path forward, building consensus and a shared mission from the ground up We speak this language: Our primary application stack includes Ruby, Rails, Postgre SQL, and Debian, but we’re enjoying using some Java Script frameworks, Go and other newer platforms depending on the project. We work to stay on the cutting edge of technology and contribute back to open source projects, because flexible frameworks build the foundation for our businesses. It feels good to give back. On average, we release two new products per year, with two code releases per day, and we’re getting faster all the time. We’re dedicated to creating quality software quickly, and we're creating a solid, stable, and flexible service-­‐oriented infrastructure to get there. This is where YOU come in: As a Lead Software Engineer you’ll be one of Company's heavy hitters, overseeing technical components of major projects. We’re going to ask you to build a bridge, and you’ll get it built, no matter what. You’ll balance technical requirements with business needs, while advocating for a high quality codebase when working with full business teams. You’re fluent in ‘technical’ language and ‘business’ language, because you’re the engineer everyone counts on to understand how it works now, how it should work,and how it will work. And through all this, you’ll make sure our younger team members develop to be amazing engineers. You’re right for this job if you: are comfortable solving problems in more than one language, and know exactly why one of them is better have built software features that required talking to multiple services, touching legacy code, and balancing multiple conflicting requirements have proven project management skills, specifically the ability to estimate scope, break up problems into deliverable chunks, and pivot when requirements change have experience with Ruby, Perl, Python, Java, or PHP have deployed multiple web applications from the perspective of both a front-­‐end and back-­‐end developer have worked with product managers to plan and scope products over the course of several releases have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or equivalent experience We’re even more impressed if you: have launched software using Ruby, Rails, Linux, Angular, Ember, or Postgre SQL employ a working knowledge of modern web standards including HTML5, CSS3 and Java Script Applications contribute regularly to popular open-­‐source projects (send us Git Hub links!) have given technical talks at conferences or meetups on subjects you are passionate about have utilized Domain Driven Design to build well structured and flexibl<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• e</p>
