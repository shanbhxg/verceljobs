About Citriot: We at Citriot build a seamlessly integrated platform with cross domain technologies such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIo T), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Industrial Automation. Citriot is involved in developing customized cross domain products and solutions for seamlessly integrating the digital world and the industrial world through the Industrial Internet of Things (IIo T) platform. Citriot deeply believes in developing its own products right from a pcb board manufacturing to end to end solution. IIo T implementation not only enhances output through better resource utilization, but also improves overall system efficiency, leading to a greater degree of products and services meeting the requisite specifications. With various sensors and our analytics tool, easily remove a product with defect from the production line, thus eliminating the chances of after-market production rejection. Predict, know and locate the fault at your fingertips even before the machine undergoes it. Automated test equipment to check the functionality of the product before sending it to the market. We guarantee better resource and asset utilization with a provision to have a digital twin of the entire plant, therefore providing you a better industrial experience. Transform your industry to a complete digital and Eco-friendly one, with automatic and efficient power utilization. Have the entire process data stored at a centralized server and retrieve it anytime for analysis. We develop products which can prove to be beneficial to the industries in order to provide better interface with the machines as well as reducing the human effort for the operations that can boost up productivity.
