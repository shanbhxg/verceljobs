We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes? Every tech company is after Java Script and Python programmers to power their enterprise platform development. At Trilogy, we acknowledge the tried-and-true power of low-level languages for obtaining high-performance applications. If you are a seasoned C++ developer with deep knowledge of systems programming, then we have an exciting opportunity for you. Trilogy is a software platform that powers 100+ B2B Saa S products, and we are on a mission to build many more. Our products are carefully architected using simple, modular, high-quality code and cutting-edge AWS technologies, not to mention that our software engineers are real product experts. We give our engineers codebase ownership so they can solve the most demanding coding problems and deliver features without regressions. In this role, you will constantly face new challenges, leveraging your C++ expertise to transform legacy on-prem products into cloud-native products or to build leading cloud-based engines from scratch. Our fast-paced environment is powered by an infrastructure that ships every merge and a broad range of technologies and products, enabling you to experience multiple products and learn at an unprecedented pace.
