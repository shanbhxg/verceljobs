A little more about us:The Games team is a small, cross-functional team within The New York Times tasked with building great puzzle experiences on a variety of devices and platforms. We’re evolving our existing Crosswords portfolio and developing a native Android app, continuing to iterate on the gameplay experience on i OS, experimenting with new puzzles that we are building from the ground up, and are heavily investing in our API infrastructure to enable new types of gameplay, create more maintainable code, and enable new product experimentation with ease. Our team cuts across all disciplines, are staffed by people who are passionate about our products and work together to provide a world-class experience for everyone who plays our games. Our group focuses on user-centered design, and is composed of tightly knit, interdependent representatives from product and project management, development and design. Through iteration, testing, empathetic research and experimentation, the games that are delivered are designed to constantly evolve, and the team members constantly strive for improvement. Who we’re looking for:We are looking for an experienced full stack engineer who enjoys thinking about product development empowerment, supporting iterative design workflows, and enabling product experimentation through repeatable and expandable systems design. Across Beta, we use a mix of Ruby, PHP, Go and Node to feed a variety of web stacks, some of which are built the old-fashioned way with a wonderful mix of application logic and presentation, and others of which are built as isomorphic React apps that use CSS modules and hot-loading.
