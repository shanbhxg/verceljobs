Budget- USD 300 ﻿Need a http/2.0+tls streaming proxy fully async implemented in rust. It needs to accept http/2.0+tls connections from clients and proxy them to our backend services over http/2.0.Requirements:1. It should be written in a clean and extensible manner in stable rust using available libraries like hyper/tokio etc as far as possible.2. Any objects/classes implemented should be fully documented. (We don’t need plain functions to be documented).3. The following should be configurable (Can declare global variables for the same):a. TLS on/off especially on the proxy side. b. Limit on max header size. c. Limit on max body size. d. How many bytes to buffer while streaming. e. Connection pool limits. f. Keep alive timesg. Connect/read/write failure timeouts. h. A logging function/log file on/off to disk or console in a concise format single line format like the popular http servers.4. It needs to be fully async – no blocking code.5. The headers will need to be consumed in one go. The headers cannot be streamed. We will write our own function to process the headers. The processing of the headers by our function will determine which backend service to connect to. Also we will add/remove/modify the headers – both from the client and from the backend.6. We require a connection pool functionality for proxying to the backend. We were looking at these two examples for a starter template. https://blog. adamchalmers. com/streaming-proxy/ and https://xnuter. medium. com/writing-a-modern-http-s-tunnel-in-rust-56e70d89870
