            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>THE CHALLENGEAccording to the American Lung Association, lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women worldwide. In 2010, there were over 150,000 deaths from lung cancer in the United States alone. To diagnose lung cancer, a pulmonologist may order a chest x-ray, a CT scan (a 3-D x-ray), or insert a small tube called a bronchoscope through the nose or mouth to observe the patient’s airways and lungs. The pulmonologist may then take a biopsy of the tumor to examine and diagnose the lung cancer. However, it is currently very difficult to navigate the bronchoscope through redundant, space-constrained airways to take an accurate biopsy. THE COMPANY Broncus Medical has commercialized and continues to develop innovative solutions for diagnosing and treating lung diseases. Physicians use Archimedes Platform to plan bronchoscopic procedures and quickly and accurately access disease tissues in the lungs. Archimedes is a powerful platform for computer-assisted, image-guided bronchoscopic planning and navigation for diagnosing and treatment of lung diseases that is intuitive and easy to use. It provides a map and visual directions through the lung airways to a lung tumor.
