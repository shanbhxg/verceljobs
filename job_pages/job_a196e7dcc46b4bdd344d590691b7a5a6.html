            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>1) 3+ Years of previous Documentum development (or Sharepoint), version agnostic. This person will not be doing any coding in this role, but will be the liaison between the users and IT to migrate legacy information into D2, assist with taxonomy, dictionaries. 2) 2+ Years in a Techno-Functional Business ADMINISTRATION/Analyst capacity where you are WORKING WITH END USERS. You will help administer the system, train end users-R&D, Pharmacy, Government, etc to understand their needs, help gather requirements (not all on this person, there is another BA), but most importantly bring those requirements to the IT teams and help them understand the technical requirements needed to meet the need. This role will also include technical writing (such as writing manuals, taking meeting minutes, etc.) 3) 1+ Project where you participated in level one support of the Documentum D2 Platform (or Sharepoint)- taking user issues (this could be as simple as not knowing how to use the system and just training the user) to Tier 1 technical issues (they would then just partner with the Development team to drive the fix). If candidate is Sharepoint instead of Documentum, will train in Documentum. Merial is a leading veterinary pharmaceutical company that provides some of the worlds most popular medications, vaccines, and more for every animal out there. One of their most popular medications is Heart Guard. Merial has been working over the last two years to create a new customized hybrid KIMS (Knowledge Information MGMT System) solution to help them streamline and automate the drug approval process. When doctors, R&D, compliance, and all of the various participants go to test/approve/rate a new medicine, there are many complex steps that must happen. In the past, this process was more manual and did not automatically move tot he next phase of approval. This caused delays in getting these medicines to the market faster. They have created this solution and they know have a great system that holds all information, automated approval processes and contacts so they can deliver these medications faster to their customers. The KIMS solution is a hybrid Documentum/Sharepoint solution and will be live by the end of Sept. The first phase after launch is where this resource will partner with another BA in Europe that will be focused on the majority of the training needed for the end users. Together, they will create training manuals, prepare dictionaries, taxonomy, and helping with local face-to-face training. This resource will be the US Subject Matter Expert for end users to come to for the KIMS system. Duties include: 50% Tier 1 Support- this is where a technical development background is crucial. They will take these technical issues and work directly with the IT teams (development, testing, etc) to help fix these issues. Without a Documentem Development background, this person would struggle ensuring the fix is done correctly. HOWEVER THERE WILL BE NO CODING IN THIS ROLE FOR THIS RESOURCE. 25% BA work- gathering requirements, meeting with end users, walking them through the system and how it works, helping create training documents, manuals, dictionaries, and taxonomy. This will require someone who has worked with end users in the past, understand how to speak to non-technical users, etc. 25%- Assisting in the migration of documents into this system. This person WILL NOT BE DOING ANY CODING, but will help the IT teams facilitate this migration and understand where the documents need to land, how they need to flow, etc. EMPHASIS ON TRAINING AND ADMINISTERING THIS KIMS SOLUTION IS KEY- must be able to walk end users through this system, how it works, etc<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• </p>
