            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>The New York Times is looking for an engineer to help work on strategic projects, focusing on leading and contributing to cross-team internal needs, and untangling internal 3rd-party dependencies, as we transition from a portfolio of individually managed products to a cohesive approach of rapid application development. A little more about us:Through Cooking, Watching, Well, Real Estate and Games, Beta has established itself as the new products division within the New York Times, focused on lifestyle content and service journalism. The group focuses on building through user-centered design, and is composed of tightly knit, interdependent representatives from product and project management, development and design. Through iteration, testing, empathetic research and experimentation, the products that are delivered constantly evolve; the team members strive to provide a world-class experience for everyone who interacts with them. Who we’re looking for:As our products mature, so to do the needs of the organization. With great expansion in both requirements and complexity, the approach of isolated products with disparate needs are slowly being replaced by an overall vision for a common toolbox, consistent features and a greater need for flexible tooling. We are looking for an experienced senior engineer to help define and build new cross-team services, and research and create enhancements to internal services outside of Beta. Through a combination of RFCs, pull requests and outreach, this role will push Beta Engineering into a new realm of collaboration: rather than create bespoke interfaces, build new features into canonical tools; instead of working around systems limitations, contribute to shared code-bases and support contributions through production deployment. To contribute to cross-team company-wide initiatives, Integration Engineers will be exposed to every technology under the sun: Node-based client-side applications; Coffeescript-based cms tools; Rails back end services deployed across multiple AWS AZs and accounts; Go-based App Engine-deployed apis; custom mvc frameworks; infinite JVM-based isolated fiefdoms; competing abstractions on nested containerization strategies; mysql, oracle and redis data stores, used separately and together, in replicating, redundant and questionably stable configurations; Mac Mini build-servers hidden under desks, forgotten about and yet mission-critical at the same time. Look under the right rock and a mainframe or two might even turn up, right next to a custom C module for PHP. To be successful in this role, you must…Appreciate that the aforementioned technology alphabet soup is illustrative of the complexities that one might run into, and is neither exhaustive of what is in use, nor an explicit expectation of the types of solutions one will contribute to Be willing to constantly balance ramp-up time on new code-bases, the weight that politics can add to the friction of code deployment and the benefit to the user, be it an internal developer or external customer Requirements and experience…Many years of hands-on authoring of APIs, preferably with Node, Go, PHP or Python Expertise in picking apart existing systems, architecting flexible editions to legacy code-bases, and documenting work to aid in hand-off and subsequent team ownership Expertise in cloud-hosted application deployment, illustrated through multiple production applications with constant high load, constructed in ways that can anticipate and accommodate spikes in a cost-sensitive, developer-friendly manner Optional: experience with implementing RFC 1149, HTCPCP, or Pigeon Rank, and relevant example<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• s</p>
