            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>FULL TIME W2 ONLY and Local to Atlanta Full Stack Java Engineer About the Company:Client was founded by data scientists and aerospace engineers with one powerful mission: Make commerce safe for business customers and create a better experience for their consumers through artificially intelligent machine learning. The mightiest companies in the world use Client’s anti-fraud technology to keep commerce moving safely. Many years back, their team journey began in university research and at the European Space Agency, Visa, Pay Pal, Amazon, Ayasdi and Experian. Right now, they’re propelling all that DNA forward and towards building a big platform to speed the business of risk management into the future. Every day, they’re re-imagining financial technology and making it better for everyone. Transparency, speed and efficiency—these are the expectations for the new generation of buyers, sellers and anyone looking to connect over commerce. About the Team:This position is part of our Client Delivery Team. Our Client Delivery Team is currently deployed 100% of their time at the client's location in Atlanta where they are engaged in several major deployments. The expected duration of the project(s) in Atlanta is 12-18 months, or until the next contract extension which would also be based in Atlanta in expected 12-month intervals. If and when the Atlanta onsite project(s) end, you will be assigned a new project with a new client and start the 100% on-site ramp up period again for that new project which can be anywhere in the USA. At the start of each new project outside Atlanta, there is a requirement to be 100% on-site for a period of 2-3 months with regular once a month weekend fly backs that Client pays for. Based on each client's unique requirements, there could be options to work remotely thereafter for the remainder of each project with periodic trips back to the client location which Client will pay for.:Need Full Stack developers to integrate products into our client's software and systems. The focus of the Full Stack Engineer will be: customizing interfaces built with Java Script and React, implementing RESTful APIs, and integrating our back-end with our client’s back-end. Our technology enables customers to detect and prevent fraud and risk before anyone else by deriving insights from data and interacting with upstream and downstream systems to influence the outcome of every transaction or event. We work with ground breaking technology (from complex event processing to No SQL, Spark, among others) to come to the best possible solution for our customers and trust our engineers to weigh in and participate in the decision-making process, as well in the end-to-end construction of the system. Often, it is not clear how that is achieved and we discover and refine them through hard work, rapid iteration, and perceptiveness. Ideal candidates learn and adapt quickly and will be able to use every tool at their disposal—software, algorithms, data structures, protocols and beyond—to understand and effectively tackle hard problems. They like to keep up to speed with new technologies and new ways of doing things.
