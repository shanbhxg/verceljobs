The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Networking team is looking for software engineers who have a passion for networking and the related software for managing large dynamic networks. We are reengineering our networking software as part of Amazon's initiative to get EC2 performance to be as close as possible to that of bare metal. This would involve being part of the team that owns building, scaling, and maintaining high performance software to streamline the managing of millions of IP addresses under our control. If you are a Software Engineer with a strong background coding under Linux and a passion for network programming and distributed systems, then this is your opportunity to own major deliverables and all aspects of the development cycle: scoping, design, implementation, and testing. You will be encouraged to exercise your judgment in proactively determining and recommending the best features, designs, and support models based on business objectives, timelines, and resource constraints.
