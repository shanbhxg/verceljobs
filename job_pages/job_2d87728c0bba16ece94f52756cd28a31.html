            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Hyperion Planning implementation specialist required by my client, a global organization and household name with HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ, to join their Financial Planning and Reporting team and act as the lead solution architect on the roll-out and implementation of Hyperion Planning on a full-time basis. The successful candidate will have experience of multiple full-cycle Hyperion Planning implementations, including but not limited to requirements gathering, design, functional build and development, UAT and go-live. Project experience is a must, as this is a highly project focused and dynamic environment, and the Hyperion Planning specialist will be expected to hit the ground running and require minimal guidance. A background in finance would be beneficial but is not essential, as the client would happily consider candidates from a development background who have more recently held implementation/architecture positions. Hands-on technical knowledge of Hyperion Planning will be essential to the position, although the build and development activities expected will be functional in nature rather than focused on the back-end. Applicants must have excellent communication and stakeholder management experience, as the successful candidate will be expected to engage with stakeholders at all levels of the business and finance communities<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• </p>
