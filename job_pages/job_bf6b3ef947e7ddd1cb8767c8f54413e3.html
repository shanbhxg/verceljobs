(www. cavirin. com Santa Clara, CA) produces the Automated Risk Analysis Platform (ARAP), a software solution to mitigate discovered risks within deployed IT infrastructure. It doesn’t matter where assets are deployed, and it doesn’t require an installed agent. You simply install the platform on premises or in the cloud, then automatically discover, score, & mitigate findings in accordance with the world’s IT regulations, standards & practices. Cavirin immediately appeals to organizations suffering from exponential asset growth, fast deployment cycles, cloud transition & the increasing chaos of modern IT. Chief Information Security Officers, Compliance Officers, and Risk Officers can work together under one platform to score, mitigate, and prove risk remediation for their customers & auditors. Cavirin differentiates from the competition by focusing upon simplicity, automation & actually solving the problems it discovers. As Cavirin expands into an Artificial Intelligence Platform in 2016, Cavirin’s market will include fully automated IT shops, and significantly reduce the human burden within IT management. Inclusion of ARAP Connectors will ingest data from security tools like Nessus & Qualys; then send remediation requests to ticketing systems & automated configuration services. Cavirin’s current platform has already been deployed in Fortune 1000 organizations. The 2016 roadmap has secured significant Fortune 100 deals and interest. Cavirin was again selected as one of the 20 hottest Cyber Security companies in 2016, and was awarded Amazon AWS recognition as one of only seven official vendors in the security/vulnerability management space.
