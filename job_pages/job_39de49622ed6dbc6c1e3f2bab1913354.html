            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>The Unified Communications (UC) Engineer position in the Networks, Data Centers, & Telecommunications (NDT) division of UW-Information Technology (UW-IT) focuses on the operations, management, and evaluation of complex data and telecommunications systems for the University. Unified communications is the integration of real-time communication services such as instant messaging (chat), presence information, telephony (including IP telephony), video conferencing, call control and speech recognition with non-real-time communication services such as unified messaging (integrated voicemail, e-mail, text messaging, and fax). UC is not a single product, but a set of products that provides a consistent unified user interface and user experience across multiple devices and media types. UC also refers to a trend to offer process integration, i. e. to simplify and integrate all forms of communications in view to optimize UW business processes and reduce the response time, manage flows, and eliminate device and media dependencies. UC Engineers are responsible for development, operations, maintenance, and support of a state of the art unified communications network environment for the University. Engineers must identify needs, either as requested by UW-IT management on behalf of UW units, or as ongoing monitoring of existing systems that may require the design and development of solutions for the requested services. Providing expert consultation to users and system managers is another essential function. Because the UW has chosen to adapt leading edge technology for evaluation, and even for its production data and telecommunications systems, the results of each project must be carefully evaluated, and lessons learned must be applied to subsequent efforts. In some cases, this involves development of UW-specific software and hardware systems. The incumbent must provide day-to-day operations, maintenance, troubleshooting, and support for advanced unified communications distributed systems that integrate multivendor systems using a common advanced communications core. In some cases this will involve development of UW-specific configurations and software. In all cases, it requires evaluation, adaptation, and integration of previously existing software and hardware systems to support research, teaching, and administrative communications requirements of UW units. Providing expert consultation to users and system managers is another essential function. The goal is high availability, high reliability, easy to use data and telecommunications environment comprised of network switching systems and servers, departmental data and telephone systems, and intelligent terminal equipment. The nature of advanced data and telecommunications systems is that they rarely “plug and play” without significant investments in analysis and experimental system integration. In some cases, this position will participate in joint study projects with data and telecommunications vendors aimed at developing improved academic data and telecommunications solutions. Providing consulting expertise to other UW researchers and staff is also an essential part of this job. A UC Engineer's focus is with communications facilities, network hardware, network protocols, operations, network management, as well as network related software. Unified Communications Engineers must possess a demonstrated understanding of TDM and IP Telephony concepts, networking/distributed computing environment concepts; knowledge of and experience with principles of routing, client/server programming, the design of consistent network-wide telephony system layout; Strong hands-on knowledge of SIP, H.323 and TCP/IP protocols; Strong understanding of Vo IP Qo S issues and mitigation strategies. Familiar with network topologies such as Frame Relay, ISDN, ATM, DWDM, SDN, SONET, etc. In addition they should have an in-depth knowledge of telecommunications systems including Avaya System Manager, Session Manager, and Communication Manager. This position requires the incumbent to work in a fast paced environment and to function in high pressure situations when outages affect critical systems. Additionally much of the work will involve creating documentation such as detailed operations and maintenance documents, as-built drawings, etc. Requirements: Bachelor’s degree in communications, engineering, computer science or related field. Four years’ experience designing, installing, operating, and supporting networked communication systems or equivalent experience Demonstrated expertise in SIP, H.323, ISDN,TCP-IP, Vo IP QOS, SNMP, RTP/RTCPExperience with IVR, E911, call recording, Avaya call centers, voice and video conferencing Demonstrated excellent written/oral communication skills, technical documentation skills, user liaison skills, and personal interaction abilities. Conditions of Employment: Must be able to respond to network outages, scheduled installations, and maintenance activities during off-hours. Must be willing to travel up to one week. Must be able to lift at least 40 pounds. This may require climbing up ladders to install equipment. Must have a valid WA driver’s license to operate State vehicles This position is temporarily funded through June 2018; ongoing employment will be dependent on availability of funds and performance. A satisfactory outcome from a criminal history verification may be required prior to hire<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• </p>
