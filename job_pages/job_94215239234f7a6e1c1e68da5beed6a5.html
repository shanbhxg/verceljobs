You work closely with the service developer engineers to define REST interfaces the UI will consume. You'll integrate ngrx with Angular 2.0 to manage application state. You will develop a module to allow end users to make contract modifications and press the "What if” button. You will collaborate directly with end users to iterate screen designs and workflows. You'll build interesting and engaging data visualizations with D3.Being on the bleeding edge of Java Script framework development, you will inevitably encounter and workaround 3rd party library version incompatibilities. You might stumble on a Java Script library and check it out to see if it brings useful capability to the applications. What you bring to the table :You're a professional with a great blend of practical experience, education, and achievement. You're efficient at getting your points across in written and verbal mediums. Agile and Scrum delivery is very familiar. You've had experience with dev/test/production environments at AWS.

Experience building interactive data visualizations with D3 or NVD3 is a plus. Confident admin skills around web and application servers.
