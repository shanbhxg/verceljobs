            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>We have taken over a half-million slices since we started. Each slice has hundreds of control parameters and dozens of metrics related to resulting image quality. At present, it is largely the responsibility of a human operator to ensure the smooth sailing of our microscopes through this complex phase-space, but as production and scanning demands increase we need to make better decisions day to day and moment to moment. Your role will initially be the analysis of collected process data and evolve into a role guiding future acquisition and control. Core Requirements:Python—Relevant experience with numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn and similar. Hardware experience—With image sensors, control systems, microcontrollers, and data acquisition Basic knowledge of process engineering stratagies—Six-Sigma, takt time Bonus:Image processing experienc<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• e</p>
