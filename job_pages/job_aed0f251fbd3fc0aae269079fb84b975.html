            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Principal Engineer Location: Boston, MA About You You love to develop software. You also love working with a team of diverse skills, backgrounds, and levels of experience. Complex problems are an enjoyable challenge. You strive for clean, bulletproof, scalable solutions, and appreciate the fact that creating a simple system from a complex set of requirements is a feat to be proud of. You are constantly aware of what you don’t know, and are constantly learning new things to fill the gaps. You are aware that this is an endless cycle of growth and understanding, and revel in it.

Your ideal day consists of good split between driving requirements, writing code, learning new techniques, and guiding teammates that may be less experienced than you are. You could roll out a solid web application end-to-end if you had to, from infrastructure setup to deployment and monitoring.
