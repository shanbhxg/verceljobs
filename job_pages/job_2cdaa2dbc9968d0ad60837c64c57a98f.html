            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Help Desk Heroes We look at our Help Desk Heroes like the Justice League of America, Avengers, and the X-Men all rolled into one. You have the Brains of Iron Man, the resources of Batman, and can control minds like Charles Xavier. OK, so, obviously you can’t actually control minds but how cool would that be? That has to be the best superpower. Maybe flying? We will leave that open for debate. KIDDING- its mind control, obviously. What you really want to know: You do not have to be bitten by a radioactive spider to be a superhero. Although it would be really cool if you could swing from buildings, best commute ever? We think so. Our commutes aren’t quite that easy but we have TONS of different locations so we will do our best to get you in the area you are looking for. We also have various shifts we are looking to fill so for anyone that likes to sleep in until noon or get up at 3am, call us (but preferably not at 3 am, we are still sleeping). You are going to love this: We want to be your career concierge- your very own Alfred, if you will. Tell us exactly what you are looking for and then sit back and relax for a minute. Let us do all the heavy lifting for you. Even Clark Kent needs a vacation day once in a while. You tell us what you are looking for in your next superhero adventure that you call a job and we will help locate it for you. Potential Hazards: Only if you start to think you actually do have superpowers. Please do not try to swing from buildings or control minds. At least not our minds. What we really don't want to tell you but will any ways: Help Desk Heroes don’t always get to work 8-5. You may have to put in some overtime if a city falls victim to a major attack. Villains don’t always strike during normal working hours. What your friends say about you: You have a great sense of humor so I know you won't take this personally. Nerd, Geek, Techy, you've been called all of these things (and you secretly LOVE it). You also look great in a cape or a mask. One of your superpowers is the ability to talk, gab, chat, and jabber with everyone and anyone. The more impressive superpower is that you are able to turn complex problems into simple solutions for the mere commonplace humans of the world. Oh yeah, we probably shouldn't forget: Not the committing type? We know living a double life and saving the world on the side can get a bit hectic. No problem, we have contract positions along with all of our permanent positions. *UNABLE TO SPONSOR OR USE CORP-TO-CORP THROUGH 3RD PARTIES AT THIS TIME* A day in the life of a Help Desk Hero: • Active Directory setting up user accounts, re-setting passwords, etc. • Remote support of all devices including phones, tablets and laptops • Support MSOffice suites and many proprietary software applications • Network connectivity troubleshooting • Troubleshoot hardware issues and repair them.
