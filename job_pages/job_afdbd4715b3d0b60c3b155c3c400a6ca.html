            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>We are looking for a Security Engineer who “grew up” as a Systems Engineer in a large Microsoft Windows workstation and server environment, with some experience with UNIX/Linux servers. Then, migrated to the Info Sec discipline to engineer solutions on those platforms using various endpoint security products. The ideal candidate would have 3 5 years’ experience in developing secure solutions for workstation and server environments. Requirements/Experience needed:We need a security engineer who has evaluated products in the FIM space, planned and executed a deployment. Also, they should have experience supporting the tools and Sec Ops processes associated with a FIM product. – This is the same requirement for all the tools below: FIM (File Integrity Monitoring) – This is a tool that’s used for monitoring the state of system files and other critical files on an endpoint (Endpoint = a server, or workstation, or point of sale device-in store register or in-store payment processing server). When the FIM agent detects that one of the critical files has been changed it sends an alert to a central console, or an email distribution list. Typical vendors in this space are (not in any specific order): Tripwire, Logrhythm, Solarwinds, Alien Vault, OSSEC (open source).Whitelisting (aka, Application Whitelisting) – not necessarily a new technology, but the endpoint space has now embraced as another layer of protection. Whitelisting products control what applications are allowed to run on an endpoint. Vendors – Bit9, Symantec, Lumension, Mc Afee Anti-Malware (anti-virus): Pretty straight forward. Vendors: Symantec, Mc Afee Vulnerability Scanning: Need an engineer experienced in configuring scan profiles, executing scans, and supporting the scan results (coordination of remediation efforts, tracking, reporting). Vendors – Qualys, Tenable Whole Disk Encryption: Vendors – PGP, Microsoft (Bit Locker product). Need experience in product deployment in an enterprise environment, as well as support and administration duties (agent deployments, reporting, recovery of disks, etc.).DLP (Data Loss Prevention): Need experience in DLP product comparisons (bake-off, POCs), solution design and deployment, operational support. Vendors – Symantec, Trend Micro, Websense, RSA<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• </p>
