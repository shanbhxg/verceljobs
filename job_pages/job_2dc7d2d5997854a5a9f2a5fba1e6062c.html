            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Randstad supports the National Weather Service (NWS) and its mission to provide weather data, forecasts, and warnings for the United States. Television weathercasters and private meteorology companies prepare their forecasts using this information. The NWS is the sole United States official voice for issuing warnings during life threatening weather situations. The National Water Center (NWC) is a geographically distributed organization, which includes elements in Alabama, Maryland, and Minnesota. The NWC collaboratively researches, develops and delivers state-of-the-science national hydrologic analyses, forecast information, data, decision-support services and guidance to support and inform essential emergency services and water management decisions. In partnership with NWS national, regional, and local offices, the NWC coordinates, integrates and supports consistent water prediction activities from global to local levels. Candidate will work with the National Water Center domain scientists to transfers scientific advances in the areas of hydrology, hydrometeorology, and hydraulics from the research arena into operational software applications. Work primarily involves translating complex scientific algorithms into robust software elements, mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, algorithm development, software implementation, program execution, analysis, validation and visualization of results. Computational Scientist (NWC) Job Location: Silver Spring, MD and Tuscaloosa, AL Specific activities will include: * Translate complex scientific algorithms into robust software elements * Develop new, and modify existing, computational software elements * Work within the community model frameworks (e. g., ESMF, WRF-Hydro, CEMS) to implement components into High Performance Computing environments * Develop accurate, effective, and efficient computational strategies for solutions to physics and numerical analysis problems * Designs and creates code, data files, and scripts to transition hydro-meteorological algorithm prototypes and processes to operational platforms nationwide * Analysis of existing scientific and numerical analysis prototypes * Software requirements analysis, design, and development using Java, C, C++, FORTRAN * Planning and strategies for general testing and stress testing of numerical analysis and software elements * Writes project documentation in compliance with applicable standards including requirements documents, design documentation, test plans, test reports, and presentations for project status reviews * Actively promotes continuous software improvement activities; reviews software and related products from other groups and verifies compliance with applicable standards; stays abreast of current software engineering practices through ongoing self-improvement Job Requirements (included but not limited to): -Master's Degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering or equivalent with advanced calculus, linear algebra, mathematical modeling and statistical analysis. -Must be proficient in prioritizing and decomposing requirements, translating them to designs, and implementing, integrating, and testing software solutions in a variety of languages including Java, C, C++, XML, and FORTRAN -Parallel programing using Open MP or MPI -Hands-on working experience with the following software/programming languages: Java, C/C++, Junit, XML, Shell Script, Python, Java Script, Perl, SWT, Java Swing, JAXB, Camel Spring, Hibernate -Job experience with the following technologies/Tools: Operating System: Linux, Unix, Web Server (e. g. Apache Tomcat) Tools/Version control: Eclipse RCP, DDD/gdb, Git, Dimension, SVN, Redmine, Jenkins, Gerrit ORDMB: Postgre SQL Web service like RESTful, SOAP -Experience working with scientific data sets OR large, complex data sets (Net CDF or GRIB experience preferred) -Must be able to obtain and maintain a national agency check and background investigation. (US Citizen Only) Desired Skills (including but not limited to): - Expertise in a particular domain science area (e. g., hydrology, hydrometeorology, hydraulics, etc.), as well as considerable expertise in computer science and mathematics? - Experience with Time Series Analysis, Spatial Analysis, R statistical analysis software, gdal geospatial libraries, Parallel processing libraries and protocols, PETSc or NCL - Knowledge of software design patterns, Class and Flow Diagrams - Experience working with visual representations of data, preferably in a geospatial environment (e. g.
