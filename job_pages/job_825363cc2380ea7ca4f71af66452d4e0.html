Using advanced machine learning and data mining techniques, we help our customers discover the best movies and TV shows. We measure data in Petabytes and streaming in Exabytes. We obsess over big picture problems like "How do we deliver video that's more reliable than the internet it's delivered over?" to low level details like "How do we squeeze maximum picture quality out of every bit delivered?" We strive to be on the forefront of new consumer technologies like UHD TV and High Dynamic Range video. We build huge scale distributed systems on the AWS cloud to make sure our service is always reliable for our customers. We use computer vision and machine learning techniques to build rich metadata about videos, and partner closely with teams like IMDb to let customers explore deeper into the TV and movies they love.
