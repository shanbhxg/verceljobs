About us: Richpanel is a fully-remote Global Saa S startup with offices in USA, Canada and India. We have rapidly grown to 1600+ e-commerce clients and have raised a seed capital from Sequoia Capital - who have also funded Apple, Google, and Whats App, to name a few. Here's what we do: The Richpanel platform helps e-commerce businesses retain their customers and increase revenue while scaling their ops. We are solving a massive problem that can often limit the revenue growth of E-commerce businesses. Businesses spend over $100B on customer service each year and we are on a mission to eliminate this roadblock using our self-service technology. What makes Richpanel unique is its focus on ‘productising’ customer support (think: Amazon - My account section) for e-commerce, so customers can self-resolve simpler issues while support agents can work on providing personalised support. With Richpanel, our customers have reported a decrease of up to 60% incoming tickets and a more delightful experience, leading to an increase in customer loyalty without hiring more customer support agents.

The leadership team at Richpanel has a track record of success in the E-commerce industry with 20+ years of experience leading multi-million dollar ventures and fortune 500 companies.
