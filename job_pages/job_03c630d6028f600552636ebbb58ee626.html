            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>The WW Marketing Analytics team is flipping traditional marketing research and analytics on its head in support of our rapidly growing global display advertising business. We use data and insights in the pre-sales process to generate demand for, and prove the value of, our advertising products. Over the last few years we've established a track record of scrappy innovation. Our team launched and scaled a first-of-its kind ad effectiveness survey methodology to measure the branding impact of ad campaigns on asynchronously connected devices. We then built and launched an Amazon retail data insights program, the first scaled marketing initiative to feature Amazon first-party retail insights shared directly with advertisers and agencies. Then we ripped apart a human-based research process and built a web-based platform that automatically generates insights statements based on syndicated data. We scaled this platform to support 9 markets and more than 2,800 internal Amazon customers in less than a year. More recently we've turned our attention to sales optimization, using regression models based on Amazon retail data and sales signals to help predict the best marketing tactics to encourage advertisers to try our products. Do these kinds of things sound like fun? Because we have a million more things to do that we know about, a million more we haven't dreamed up yet, and we need best-in-class predictive models and BI automation to get it all done. We're looking for a talented and driven Business Intelligence Engineer to help scale our existing programs and power rapid innovation to empower us to stay ahead of our customers' needs.
