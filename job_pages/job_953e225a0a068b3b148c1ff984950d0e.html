            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>The Need:The client is not satisfied with the system implementer’s Workday Payroll consultant, and is seeking a replacement. The current Payroll consultant is a functional consultant with several years of experience implementing different payroll systems, including SAP and more recently Workday. She has had prior Workday payroll implementation experience, and this is not her first Workday project. Main issues are that she is perceived as not being a go-getter, and lately has not come prepared to design discussions and data validation meetings, leading to wasted time and effort for the client. Client has had a bad experience with an underperforming consultant in Phase I whom they did not insist on being replaced, and does not want to repeat that mistake again, though they know that it is a tough decision. As such, any new resource will need to be of high caliber that would not lead to a recurrence of the current issue. Important: The key business owner on the client side is a new Payroll Manager who has experience using Workday Payroll at their previous company. As such, the client business owner is highly proficient with Workday Payroll and thus has limited tolerance for a resource who does not know their stuff. Skills required:Experience implementing Payroll systems in ERP systems, and prior experience implementing Workday Payroll. This resource is the single Payroll functional consultant on the project who will design and configure the Workday Payroll module for the client. The design phase is mostly complete and a unit testing cycle has been completed, so design is about 75% complete. Experience loading, validating and troubleshooting history conversion data from the legacy Payroll system to Workday. This is a key task as 3 quarters of 2016 history will be loaded and validated in Workday. Assist client during the different testing cycles and ensure that they are performing the test scenarios correctly. Demonstrated ability to lead client discussions, provide recommendations based on past experience, and assist client to enable them to be successful with their project tasks. Comfortable with being the sole Payroll lead on the project. Ability to adapt to a fast-paced and demanding client environment. The project tasks will not change, but the pace will alter depending upon client resources’ bandwidth and availability. Client resources have their “day job” of running Payroll on the current legacy system and thus run very lean during the weeks that they run Payroll (every other week)<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• </p>
