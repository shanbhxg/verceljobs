            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>About Audible: Audible, Inc. is the world's largest seller and producer of spoken audio entertainment, information and educational programming. Since inventing and commercializing the first portable digital audio player in 1997, our focus on technological innovation and superior programming has earned us millions of subscribers around the world. We're an Amazon subsidiary with a presence on three different continents, yet we maintain a startup vibe and small company feel. We offer more than 300,000 downloadable audiobooks, audio editions of periodicals, and other programs, and an escalating array of listening products that enrich daily life for a growing population of people who want to be more productive, well-informed, and thoughtfully entertained. About the Team: Within Audible we have built a Core Engineering Group that owns tools, frameworks and services. The Core Engineering Group enables other development teams within the organization to build and ship software quickly and with a high bar of engineering excellence. This team builds awesome frameworks that development teams use to rapidly develop new experiences. We provide processes that keep our teams unblocked and highly productive but we do so in a way that's much more exciting than this sentence. We listen to our customers and the tech industry and it's our responsibility to push Audible into new places; wherever our customers are listening. That's really an excuse to experiment with things like adaptive streaming, home automation, wearables or even the Raspberry Pi. This opportunity specifically is on the i OS team within the Core Engineering Group. This team is building foundational components and design patterns used across our complete i OS ecosystem. We need your help to develop and deliver on this vision in an iterative manner. Success means we lay the foundation for continued expansion of our company without disrupting an already tremendously successful and much loved product. As an engineer on our team you'll be expected to write great code, execute on your ideas, challenge the status quo and generally make things better. You'll need the soft-skills too; Communication, influence and passion are key to the success of the team and ultimately the company. You'll experience all the challenges, ambiguity and opportunities of a new team with a new mission but for the right candidate that's part of the fun. About the Role: * Own key services within our platform. "Owning" means envisioning, designing, creating, building and supporting. These services need to operate with a high degree of operational excellence (we measure EVERYTHING). * Support our developers. "Support" means be the go-to-person for questions but never be a bottle-neck, see around the corner and anticipate developers' needs, host brown bags, knowledge-transfer sessions and generally evangelize the platform. * Partner with product management to imagine, design, develop, test, and launch software that wows our community and inspires our peers. * Be willing to explore and learn un-prompted. Bring problems AND solutions to the table. * Lead the way - "Lead" means staying up to date with tools, trends, technologies and best practices both industry-wide and within Amazon and then sharing that knowledge in a meaningful way with the community.
