            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>12 months contract for a Cell Biology and Mass Spectrometry Researcher in Santa Clara, California Job Description: In this position you will be working with an interdisciplinary team in the Research Labs, comprising experts in chemistry, molecular and cellular biology, computer science, physics, and engineering that is working to invent and develop a novel mass spectrometry measurement platform for cell biology. As a part of this effort, you will: • Conduct research applying the mass spectrometer to cell biology applications, particularly in the field of metabolomics, lipidomics and glycomics from very small sample sizes. This position will be responsible for helping to develop and test novel devices to improve the performance of mass spectrometers for cell-based applications. • Collaborate closely with analytical biochemistry, molecular biology and computational research staff to design, plan and perform experiments, collect data, and conduct data analysis. • Communicate progress and results to the research and development team and to management. Qualifications: Required: 1. Ph. D. in Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Biophysics, Applied Physics, Engineering or other relevant field, or equivalent. 2. Demonstrated success in leading edge contributions to advancing the state of mass spectrometry on biological samples by a thesis and/or peer-reviewed publications. 3. Experience with metabolomic, lipidomic, or proteomic measurement technologies based on HPLC and Mass Spectrometry. 4. Demonstrated success in contributing to interdisciplinary teams, excellent communication and teamwork skills. 5. Strong problem solving and quantitative data analysis expertise. Desired: 1. Experience with design and optimization of ion sources or sample introduction systems for Mass Spectrometry. 2. Experience with metabolomic, lipidomic, or proteomic sample prep and extraction methods from mammalian cells, yeast, or E. coli. 3. Previous cell biology laboratory experience.
