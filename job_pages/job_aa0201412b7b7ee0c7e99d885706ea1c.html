            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>WANTED: Rockstar Developers Let’s face it. There’s a lot of code to write, and there’s no shortage of basement-dwelling nerds with their first laptop tucked under their skinny arms, ready to try their shaky hands at getting that daunting job done. When your Grandma needs a blog to document her Bridge-playing adventures, she can call that kid. But fortunately for us, that’s just not our bag. You see, we write hardcore, top-shelf software applications and build real, functional, and gorgeous sites for clients willing to pay well because they don’t want n00bish code babble; they demand code poetry. And we are their army of Shakespears. Who is White Sunrise?White Sunrise is a successful web and application development company based out of Marietta, Georgia. We’ve been around since 2008 helping customers grow their businesses, gain more clients, sell more, and just generally be more awesome. We help our clients leverage the power of technology and the Internet so they can put it to work for them. We consult, we counsel, we dream, we build, and we deliver awesome code and excellent products. And so far, our clients have responded by rewarding us with their repeat business and with their referrals. We know that our clients don’t need developers, they need a partner. So our approach is relational, practical, and down-to-earth. We treat them like we would want to be treated because it’s the right thing to do and a great way to grow. And so far, it’s working. What Are We Looking For?We’re seeking web developers with a minimum of 2 3 years experience in the field. Candidates will help develop large websites, e Commerce and online software releases and incremental product support and improvements. And if you’ve got people skills, too, we’ll put you in direct contact with our customers if the need arises. What’s In It For Us:We get a top-shelf developer to participate in developing code modules, perform testing, perform upgrades, and to innovate with us in the software and web design process. We get someone capable of autonomy and able to work with limited supervision, yet still independently deliver mind-blowing code. We get a team player who integrates well with the larger team and fits well with our unique, sought-after culture. We get a self-starter who is constantly planning, prioritizing and documenting functional changes, enhancements, and updates to code. We require someone that meets deadlines, can multi-task like a chainsaw-juggling unicyclist, and can achieve measurable goals. We get a problem solver who is adept at researching solutions and techniques as required for projects because they just can’t help themselves from always delivering the very best solution for the client. We get a warrior who delivers what they promise when they promise, who doesn’t make excuses, and who always strives for self-improvement and blowing the client’s mind with awesomeness. What’s In it For You:You get to be part of a proven, successful team. White Sunrise has seen massive, positive growth year-over-year because we consistently deliver well for clients. The hive is always buzzing with projects because the word about our results is out there. You get to be autonomous. We only hire A-list players who manage themselves well. We begin with the fact that we are all adults who are doing what we love and won’t accept anything less than executing our very best, simply because we love what we do that much. You get to be challenged. We solve complex, interesting problems, and we’ll draw on your experience and expertise to determine the best solution. You can leave the (cube) farm. Forget the fluorescent lighting, TPS reports, and fights against traffic. Office life is for suckers. We don’t have an office, and we see that as an asset. A distributed team model frees us to work from places that inspire us to bring our very best to the table, unencumbered by geography. You decide your dress code. As long as you bring your A-game every day, we don’t care if you’re in your pajamas or bermuda shorts. You decide your hours. If you’ve found that the office 9 to 5 is a drag on doing your very best work, you’re in good company. If you write your best code in the wee hours of the morning, fine. If your day goes better in multiple 90 minute sprints, fine. As long as we can count on you when we need you, that’s what matters. You make good, dependable income. Our pay is very competitive, and we have lots of great work to do. The better your code and the more valuable you are, the more we’ll use you. If you’re awesome, we’ll pay you for it.

We let you handle that. We also don’t pay for insurance, but we’ll compensate you enough to help cover these necessary expenses. Usually 1099 gigs mean the work isn’t reliable or consistent.
