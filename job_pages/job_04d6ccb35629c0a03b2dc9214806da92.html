            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>The Opportunity:Industry research has shown that nearly two thirds of all projects fail to complete on time and on budget. Gurnet Consulting (Gurnet) is changing that! Gurnet is a consulting firm that specializes in delivering Portfolio, Program, and Project Management professional services for our clients. Since our inception in 2008, we have successfully led the execution of over $650M in client project initiatives. Our objective is simple; to become the premier provider of project execution services in the Boston and Providence marketplace by helping companies deliver their business strategy goals through exceptional project management. Inc. 5000 has named Gurnet as one of America’s fastest growing private companies and we are looking to hire more “rock star” Program and Project Managers to our team. Ideal candidates will be those looking for a career in consulting with a small, but rapidly growing firm and a desire to use their passion and skill in project management in the delivery of professional services. So, what is it like to work for Gurnet?Always Learning - Since no two client projects are the same, our Project Managers are learning more than just structure and process. Each client environment has its own set of challenges; which forces our consultants to constantly make adjustments to their approach. Great People, Great Projects and Great Clients - If you like working with others as a team with a common goal of successful project delivery, then Gurnet will bring out the best in you. Never a Dull Moment - The ever changing nature of our client project work can be challenging. This type of variety is not for everyone, but if repetitive, mundane, procedure driven work seems boring to you, then you should consider Gurnet. Make an Impact - Sure, some clients can be demanding, unpredictable and even a bit crazy at times; but there is nothing more satisfying than being able to create and deliver a new solution that delights a customer. Recognition and Reward - Because our Project Managers are always working to improve the condition of our clients, the value to our customers is high and our people are rewarded accordingly. Making a Difference - At Gurnet, we place an emphasis on team collaboration and communication and provide an environment where your thoughts, ideas and suggestions are welcomed and encouraged. Being a Project Management consultant at Gurnet is interesting, challenging and always changing. Consulting might not be for everyone, but most will benefit from the discipline, constant learning and relationship building that is inherent to the profession. It is a great way to learn about a variety of industries, client environments, project types, people and technology; but, mostly you get to learn about yourself! If you consider yourself to be a “rock star” Project Manager and are open to exploring a situation that is superior to what you are doing today, then you likely have what it takes to be a Gurnet employee.
