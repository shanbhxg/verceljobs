This tool allows system performance engineers to monitor the network and take corrective action as quickly as possible. The project consists of a purpose-built application server for processing the call record stream, calculating statistics and populating the database; a thick Java client for presenting the data to the users in table, chart and map form; and an alarming tool for alerts based on current vs. historical performance. Deliverables: - Work on all phases of the SDLC – from minor bug fixes to enhancement design and implementation - Work on user interface enhancements and bugs; algorithmic changes to the statistics engine; or adding user customization and preferences. Candidate should have a strong understanding of, and practical experience with Java. - Large-scale production software troubleshooting. - Work in a large-scale production environment with millions of lines of code. There is a separate tool for each infrastructure vendor that cleint buys base stations and for each air interface that our network operates on so the code is written modularly and leveraged across the systems.
