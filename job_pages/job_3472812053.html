Additional Information:
About us We are building an omni-channel platform curating all things home and living. Home is a large $25B+ market, growing 12%+ Yo Y but furnishing this space is still a broken experience. Supply is fragmented and diverse and there is very low brand salience. Customers struggle to discover new brands, find it inconvenient to shop/scroll through multiple stores and collections, and can’t find products they like at affordable prices. Dusaan is a one-stop marketplace for brands across furnishings, decor, kitchenware, accent furniture. We inspire the user with content and a differentiated product experience, and help them discover the best styles from a curated selection of existing and new brands. We differentiate by curating products across categories, building trust through a closed marketplace, content led selling, hybrid online-offline model with partner stores for furniture & ancillaries.
