This Incubator will be asked to leverage the best of breed technology in UX/UI, Big Data, Search, Mobile, Social Media, Product Management and best Open Source technology available!This team sits within R&D Product Division and works closely with them. It is not a hardcore developer. Essentially, these people will build mini apps through prebuilt libraries that leverage modern Javascript frameworks and are powered by enterprise class microservices architecture. Will need to understand the Framework of the apps that are built. Will serve as sort of a Business Systems Analyst/Development Configurator. Sit with business to understand what each of their specific needs/requirements are for visualizing and using the product. Will sit in Agile meetings with Developers to understand the technology and product components being built. Will configure and customize the technical components for the customer - based on the business logic needed. Assembling for final consumption at user site…. Make the product work for the client. Need a good understanding of development and how to produce software (but you are not a deep coder at all).Metadata architecture will be built by other team, and you will help to assemble into a product for the customer. Need to configure = move off pallets onto screens. See that objects have more hr and business logic built in. How will product be represented on screen? How will it flow? What calculations need to occur?Will always be thinking “how can I make this work for the client?” “ How should the reusable components (modules) be built or placed in order to satisfy this users’ needs?”Would be great to know Agile (will work in scrum teams) Should know one language (C#, Java, Ruby, etc)Growth path either toward the deeper programming and development/architecture OR toward the Product side with Product mgt or product ownership. Team will also be building out test automation frameworks, regression tests, continuous automation, etc. So they would look at interesting QA people for this also. Can come from DEV or BSA or QA. (he is open to talent and expects to have to hire a few different types to see what works.). Contact: rich@silversearchinc. co<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• m</p>
