            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>External Job Description ======================== Amazon. com's Display Advertising team builds and manages systems with extreme high performance and availability. We serve and respond to hundreds of billions of requests annually, and have ambitions to grow that number several orders of magnitude, while maintaining response latencies in the milliseconds and meeting strict SLA requirements. We delight in data, and are constantly trying to enrich our models and make more informed decisions using every bit and byte we have. Our current systems serve our current needs, but we are growing a new business within Amazon. com, and are looking for the sort of hands on leaders who can design and build the systems that will take us into the future. About you: You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space. You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given an opportunity to own and drive initiatives through the entire software stack -- from algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume. About us together: We're going to change the way that the advertising world measures, plans, and buys. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team. The ideal person for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment and passion for building a great customer experience, be inventive, and have a strong track record of delivery. You also have a pragmatic approach and iterative approach to building software: you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams. Some problem spaces we'll be working on: DELIVERY PROGRAM - The Delivery team owns the systems, which enable core functionality that support ad delivery against customer expectations across all our advertising programs (Class 1, AAP, ESS, AMS). This specifically relates to the delivery engine, as well as delivery measurement, monitoring, and alerting system(s). In addition this team owns the definition of delivery KPIs (and corresponding goals) for our customers' and will iterate to improve them. The Delivery Excellence Program owned by this team, was born out of the need to guarantee accurate delivery, and aims to surface and remedy existing gaps in delivery and add the monitoring, visualization, and tooling necessary to proactively safeguard and improve delivery. As we iterate over this program, we expect to gain insights and understanding of delivery and how it impacts yield, pricing, performance with a view to maximize for supply and demand.
