            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Do you like problem solving? Do you like creating websites with Notepad just because you can? Does the opportunity to try a variety of technologies intrigue you? If so, SSB BART Group (SSB) may be the right company for you. The mission of SSB BART Group is to support organizations in ensuring that their digital systems - web sites, web applications, Mobile applications, software, hardware, and services - are accessible to users with disabilities. A Technical Accessibility Analyst is the person who works with these organizations to review their digital systems then provide the real-world solutions that have a positive impact on the experience of all their users, especially those with disabilities. Qualifications Technical Experience Candidates must understand the core elements needed to build a web site or web application, e. g., you understand what is needed to create a basic web page without tools like Dreamweaver, Eclipse, or Bootstrap. A good understanding of Java Script and CSS are also required. Experience developing non-web based user interfaces, PDF documents, and regulations, such as Section 508, the ADA, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 is a plus. Testing Focus A desire to review, validate, and provide solutions to improve user interface compliance with accessible design specifications is critical. Communicative Candidates must be able to clearly and effectively communicate with clients in both written and verbal fashion. Written communication should show a high attention to detail. Verbal communication should be formal and indicate the ability to communicate complex topics concisely. This position interacts directly with customers and it is imperative that it inspires confidence when speaking with customers. Organized and Disciplined - SSB has a culture of disciplined execution over a long period of time. We seek to hire and advance people that have this focus and can execute activities on their own, over a long period of time without a large amount of management oversight. A candidate that will succeed in this environment must have a desire to grow in the company over time and seek to build towards big goals. Excellence Focused - At SSB, we have been successful because we constantly seek to be the best in our market across all of the products and services we provide. Think the Ritz Carlton, not the Holiday Inn. In practice, that means we both charge more and invest more, with the end goal of providing far more value per dollar spent than our competitors. It also means that we focus on a very high level of quality and hold ourselves accountable for delivering against that level of quality.<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• Technical Experience Candidates must understand the core elements needed to build a web site or web application, e<br>• g<br>• , you understand what is needed to create a basic web page without tools like Dreamweaver, Eclipse, or Bootstrap<br>• A good understanding of Java Script and CSS are also required<br>• Experience developing non-web based user interfaces, PDF documents, and regulations, such as Section 508, the ADA, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2<br>• 0 is a plus<br>• Testing Focus A desire to review, validate, and provide solutions to improve user interface compliance with accessible design specifications is critical<br>• Communicative Candidates must be able to clearly and effectively communicate with clients in both written and verbal fashion<br>• Written communication should show a high attention to detail<br>• Verbal communication should be formal and indicate the ability to communicate complex topics concisely<br>• This position interacts directly with customers and it is imperative that it inspires confidence when speaking with customers<br>• Organized and Disciplined - SSB has a culture of disciplined execution over a long period of time<br>• We seek to hire and advance people that have this focus and can execute activities on their own, over a long period of time without a large amount of management oversight<br>• A candidate that will succeed in this environment must have a desire to grow in the company over time and seek to build towards big goals<br>• Excellence Focused - At SSB, we have been successful because we constantly seek to be the best in our market across all of the products and services we provide<br>• Think the Ritz Carlton, not the Holiday Inn<br>• In practice, that means we both charge more and invest more, with the end goal of providing far more value per dollar spent than our competitors<br>• It also means that we focus on a very high level of quality and hold ourselves accountable for delivering against that level of quality<br>• Responsibilities Testing The Technical Accessibility Analyst will test clients systems against specific manual and assistive technology tools<br>• The Technical Accessibility Analyst will enter test results into SSBs Accessibility Management Platform (AMP) the industrys first on-demand solution that integrates the business and technical aspects of complying with regulations, such as Section 508, the ADA, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2<br>• 0<br>• Remediation The Technical Accessibility Analyst will be required to provide realistic technical guidance to clients that can be integrated into current or new user interfaces<br>• Test Set Definition The Technical Accessibility Analyst will work with the client to determine the boundaries of the testing environment by identifying a representative test set of the user interface components found in the clients system<br>• Reporting The Technical Accessibility Analyst will deliver testing results to the client and will participate in conference calls and follow-up discussions in order to create a road map to improve the accessibility and usability of the clients IT system Application Process Salary is commensurate with experience<br>• This is a full-time, salaried position with a competitive benefits package<br>• It is being offered in the San Francisco, CA office<br>• SSB BART Group is committed to workforce diversity<br>• Equal Opportunity Employer<br>• Copyright 2016, SSB BART Group<br>• All rights reserved</p>
