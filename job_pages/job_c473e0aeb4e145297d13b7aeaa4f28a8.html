            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Guidewire Software is looking to hire a Senior Test Engineer to analyze and test the features of Guidewire's web-based enterprise scale applications as part of a collaborative, fast-paced team. As a member of the core development team, you would work closely with product managers and Java developers. At Guidewire, we use Agile programming techniques, such as test-driven development, continuous integration and testing, and story-based iterative development to build better software and to build software in a better way. We have found that the role of the dedicated QA Engineer is imperative to releasing quality results. In this role we look for critical thinkers - people who can rapidly consume domain knowledge and determine comprehensive, meaningful tests based on close collaboration with our Product Managers and industry experts. We place a high value on exploratory testing - testers spend the bulk of their time in the application finding issues based on an educated awareness of both specific requirements and customer's expectations. Testers partner with development, giving continual feedback and working together to improve automated test coverage. For most people this is a very different development environment than the typical process of "throwing code over the wall" for QA to test. QA Engineers are part of the process with product managers and developers from the beginning and work in partnership to make sure that the code is high quality at all times rather than tested at the end. We have a work environment that encourages individual initiative, experiments with new ideas for continuous improvement, and lets great people do great work by minimizing the hassles of hierarchy and bureaucracy. We strongly value test-driven development. Our test framework runs over 100K tests regularly for every branch. We constantly improve and brainstorm how to improve coding and testing processes. Our software is great, the coffee is okay, and the buildings are decent enough. What’s special, though, is that we’re a team passionately focused on customer success and our long term goals. Talk to people here and you’ll immediately sense their enthusiasm. We write software the way we’ve always wanted to write it. We want smart, motivated people to help build the future for ourselves and our customers. We are proud of what we build and how we work together.
