        <p>About the job About us: Ahmedabad International School (AIS) was founded 22 years ago  on the belief that self-learning leads to lifelong learning. The AIS community inculcates a love for learning  fosters social and emotional acuity  develops responsible global citizens  and builds a strong academic foundation.AIS is an IB World School where students fall in love with learning  discover their passions  and prepare for the world beyond the classroom. AIS is over 1600 students strong across K-12 with some of the finest placements in the world. AIS alumni are represented at Stanford  Columbia  Cornell  Brown  Carnegie Mellon  Oxford  Cambridge  Imperial  St. Andrews  IITs  NLUs  and many more distinguished universities.Our goal is to build a learning community like no other - one where students and teachers feel empowered to do their best work. AIS teachers are critically reflective practitioners who wear multiple hats - facilitators  mentors  learners  friends  researchers  and collaborators. They ask and ponder over hard questions like ‘what is the role of a teacher when information is available at a click’  ‘how do we design learning that is challenging and significant’  and much more.
