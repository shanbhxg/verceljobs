            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Century Link (NYSE: CTL) is a global communications, hosting, cloud and IT services company enabling millions of customers to transform their businesses and their lives through innovative technology solutions. Century Link offers network and data systems management, Big Data analytics and IT consulting, and operates more than 55 data centers in North America, Europe and Asia. The company provides broadband, voice, video, data and managed services over a robust 250,000-route-mile U. S. fiber network and a 300,000-route-mile international transport network. About Century Link Cloud Century Link Cloud (CLC) is the focal point for all cloud-related development inside the larger Century Link Corporation. We consciously maintain our small company/startup feel, while taking advantage of the resources available from such a large company. As such, we have a very strongly focused Dev/Ops culture, highly skilled agile workforce, with development as our core activity. We build the cloud, we build the applications that run on it, and we make it run: Every day, all the time. It’s what we do. At CLC, we’ve created an environment where people come together to work hard and drive results, but also offer flexibility and work-life balance. CLC is a high growth venture-backed company recognized by industry analysts as an up-and-coming cloud service provider and an innovator in cloud software. Job Summary: We have an opening for an experienced Senior Software Development Engineer to expand our team of engineers who are developing Century Link’s cloud infrastructure. Just like everyone else, we want to hire unbelievably bright developers, who are a joy to work with, love to work with others, solve problems, listen well, and lead as appropriate. Oh, yeah, they have to love to learn new things, too. You should have a passion for cloud computing and for creating applications and services that make developers’ lives easier while helping them create their enterprise-ready applications. Limiting yourself to just one area of the technology stack would be unthinkable for this kind of developer, so we hope that you are comfortable doing everything from creating beautiful, friendly UIs, to crafting logical and easy to use APIs, all the way to writing distributed computing algorithms between applications running on entirely different clouds. Since our teams operate using a combination of agile development practices and processes, you’d be encouraged to work in pairs, write your code test first, and think about things like cycle time and WIP limits. All of this adds up to an exciting, challenging, and always interesting place to work, where hard problems are found and solved every day. Requirements/Qualifications: • 7+ years’ software development experience. • 5+ years’ experience with a modern programming language like; C#, Ruby, Go or Java Script. • 3+ years’ of experience designing, building and operating highly available, highly reliable web-based systems • Familiarity with programming concurrent and/or distributed systems. • 2+ years of agile software development experience, TDD and refactoring. • Experience developing and operating highly available, highly reliable systems. • Good collaboration and communication skills.
