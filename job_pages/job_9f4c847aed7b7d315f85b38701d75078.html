            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>We’re looking at building a responsive web application for our client’s product they are a Fortune 500 company in Chicago. The meat of this web app will sit within the client’s domain and what we are building is simply the UI – I’m assuming HTML5, CSS3, and Java Script (Angular most likely for UI interactions, displays, and simple data visualizations) will be required to build out some simple forms, presentation of data returned from the client’s backend, and integration to a third party vendor. Much of the interaction with the client back-end will be managed via the client’s APIs and any third party vendor interactions will either launch a separate experience managed by the vendor or will be very minimal in terms of code development. The start date is 7/25 Contract will be finished end of Septembe<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• r</p>
