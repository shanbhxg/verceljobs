            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Microsoft Word - 09.21.2016 Senior Software Engineer. docx Title: Senior Software Engineer 077 - Gene Lab IT/Data Systems Desired Start Date: ASAPHours Per Week: Full-time Summary:Gene Lab is a jointly sponsored project by the International Space Station Research Integration Office (ISSRIO) at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) and the Human Exploration and Operation Mission Directorate’s (HEOMD) Space Life and Physical Sciences Division (SLPSD). It is designed to conduct space bioscience experiments, produce “omics” (e. g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) data, and leverage the value of large omics data made available from molecular networks and translational research experiments conducted onboard the ISS and other flight opportunities. The Gene Lab project is both a science collaboration initiative to maximize the omics data collected from spaceflight and from ground simulations of microgravity and radiation experiments; and a data system effort to establish a public bioinformatics repository and collaborative analysis software platform. The goal of this project is to build a software platform for researchers to access and use NASA data as "Open Data, Open Science", the software platform will serve as a service that makes these data sets available, citable, discoverable, interpretable, reusable, and reproducible. The software engineer in expected to be a part of on- going development efforts as well as support operations on existing software platform. The candidate is expected to comply with standard software development practices. Skills/Qualifications:1. A degree in Bioinformatics. 2. Experience with Database Systems, Relational and No SQL 3. Data Interchange Formats: XML, JSON 4. Strong experience with programming languages like JAVA, Python, Java Script 5. Exceptional written and oral communication skills 6. Detail-oriented pro-active working style 7. Capable of both self-directed independent work and participation in inter- disciplinary teams 5. Experience using Standard Biocomputational Tools Other Desired Skills Familiarity with the following: 1. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and RESTful web services. 2. Knowledge on omics data standards. 3. Bioinformatics systems like NIH GEO or EBI PRIDE systems. 4. Full-text search engines (e. g., Elastic search, Lucene, Solr) 5. Bioinformatics Open Source Platforms (e. g., Genome Space, Cy Verse, KBase, etc.<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• :1<br>• A degree in Bioinformatics<br>• 2<br>• Experience with Database Systems, Relational and No SQL 3<br>• Data Interchange Formats: XML, JSON 4<br>• Strong experience with programming languages like JAVA, Python, Java Script 5<br>• Exceptional written and oral communication skills 6<br>• Detail-oriented pro-active working style 7<br>• Capable of both self-directed independent work and participation in inter- disciplinary teams 5<br>• Experience using Standard Biocomputational Tools Other Desired Skills Familiarity with the following: 1<br>• Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and RESTful web services<br>• 2<br>• Knowledge on omics data standards<br>• 3<br>• Bioinformatics systems like NIH GEO or EBI PRIDE systems<br>• 4<br>• Full-text search engines (e<br>• g<br>• , Elastic search, Lucene, Solr) 5<br>• Bioinformatics Open Source Platforms (e<br>• g<br>• , Genome Space, Cy Verse, KBase, etc<br>• )</p>
