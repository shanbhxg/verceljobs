However  business users in every company struggle to get access to accurate and reliable data. Data resides fragmented across the 100s of business software that businesses use. The majority of the data operators’ time is spent manually consolidating data and too little in deriving insights.If this ‘collection’ can be automated  it can lead to making business decisions faster  unlocking exponential growth  and delivering a superior experience to customers.At Hevo  our mission is to enable every company to be data-driven. We started on this journey 4 years back and as the first step in this direction  we built our first product – “Data Pipeline” or simply “Pipeline”.Hevo Pipeline is a no-code platform that helps companies to connect all their sources of data within the company to get a unified view of their business. The platform offers integrations with 100+ data sources such as Databases  SaaS applications  Advertising Channels  etc.Today  we enable 1000+ companies across 40+ countries to be more data-driven.
