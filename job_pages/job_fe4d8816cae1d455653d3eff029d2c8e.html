(Non-US citizens may not be eligible to obtain a security clearance. The Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) an agency of the Department of Defense, handles and adjudicates the security clearance process. Security clearance factors include, but are not limited to, allegiance to the US, foreign influence, foreign preference, criminal conduct, security violations and drug involvement. Employment is contingent on other factors, including, but not limited to, background checks and drug screens. ). - U. S . Citizenship status is required as this position will need a U. S. Security Clearance within 1 year of start date . Do you have this Basic Qualification? Candidates must be currently enrolled in a BS or MS degree program (or completed a degree no more than 18 months prior to start date) with an emphasis in Electrical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics or related engineering or science curriculum. Candidate must also have the a bility to obtain a security clearance. - U. S . Citizenship is required. Do you have any of the following Desired Qualifications? GPA of 3.0 or higher MS Degree (would be a plus) Customer focus and collaboration skills Excellent written and oral communication skills Strong analytical skills Experience with hardware/software design for embedded control Experience with VHDL or Verilog Exposure to Electromagnetic simulation tools such as Ansoft HFSS, HP ADS, and analytical tools such as Mat Lab/Simulink Familiarity with simulation and CAD tools is a plus Knowledge of MS Office or other presentation tools One or more of the following courses: Microwave/RF Engineering, Electromagnetic Theory, Antenna Theory, Communications, Power Electronics Design, Digital Design, Digital Signal Processing, Control Systems Design Previous internship or co-op with a defense contractor and/or government agency Some project work or co-op/intern experience in control systems design, digital design, Power or Analog design, antenna or RF/Microwave design, analysis or simulation Willingness to travel for company business to non-Raytheon facilities Be a key contributor to our Electrical Design team- Members of the Electrical Design Directorate hold key roles in all of Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) programs. The work performed in the Electrical Design Directorate falls within many different categories. An example of the work that is performed within one of the departments in this directorate is working with phased array antenna design teams who analyze array performance, examine time side lobes, noise figure, noise floor, and other parameters. This would require someone that is familiar with numerical modeling techniques and tools so that they could determine the impact of array performance on radar or communication system performance. Working in this directorate involves close cooperation and communication with other engineering disciplines including systems, mechanical, and software. Engineers in this directorate also follow through their designs into production supporting manufacturing operations and system integration and test functions. Teamwork, trust and accurate results are essential to the success of working within the Electrical Design Directorate. 90416 Last Modified: 1/3/2017 3:03:17 PM Category: Electrical Engineering, Engineering, College, All Job Type: College Job<br>Responsibilities:• <br>Qualifications:• ?
