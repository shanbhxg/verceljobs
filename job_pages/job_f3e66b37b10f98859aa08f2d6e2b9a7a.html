            <p id="jobDescription"><br>Additional Information:<br>Job Description Quidsi is a subsidiary of Amazon and entrepreneurial parent company to Diapers. com, Soap. com, Wag. com, Beauty Bar. com, Yoyo. com, and Casa. com. We are a mom-centric retail technology company. We deliver delightful experiences, products, and expertise by offering a curated selection of products, lightning-fast delivery, incredible customer service, and an easy-to-navigate shopping experience. Quidsi's sites are host to millions of daily visitors, and our warehouses are run by hundreds of autonomous Kiva robots. Our entire operation, from our websites/apps to our fulfillment centers and customer care center, is focused on creating an enjoyable end-to-end customer experience. To get there, we need exceptionally talented, bright, and driven people who are energized by "what if" (the meaning of Quidsi in Latin). If you'd like to help us build the place where people can find and buy anything online, come and innovate with us! We are looking for User Researcher/Data Analyst who has experience applying a variety of qualitative and quantitative UX research methods in a fast-paced and rapidly changing product development environment. S/he will be comfortable diving deep into complex subject matter to help shape the direction of new product designs and will regularly step back to ask big questions that impact the overall customer experience. This role requires the ability to collaborate with and influence others including designers, engineers, business owners and executives. Most importantly, it requires a relentless determination to do what is right for Quidsi's customers. In this role, you will be responsible for driving and implementing a research strategy - possibly inventing some new research techniques along the way. Your research will be agile, keeping pace with rapid innovation in the Product & UX team. We move fast and iterate continually. You will be right there with them, but you will also find time to zoom out and ask the big questions that change the course of these programs, or prompt us to build entirely new ones. You will interact daily with product managers, designers and business owners to understand and guide the team's research needs, including designing and conducting user research studies and activities. An ideal candidate will have a deep understanding of qualitative user research methods and best practices, with working knowledge of quantitative user research and analysis. You should have a nimble, creative and pragmatic approach, and be interested in pushing the boundaries of agile research. You are a passionate researcher with uncanny observational and analytical skills, an impressive ability to collaborate with other teams and designers, and a relentless determination to do what is right for Quidsi customers. You can work with minimal direction and are capable of working quickly while delivering high-quality outputs. You will work on overlapping projects, so are good at multi-tasking, juggling competing priorities, and organizing yourself.<br>Responsibilities:• * Partner closely with Product and UX to identify research opportunities and prioritize research questions based on analysis of current product designs, business needs, project goals, and risks<br>• * Employ the best research method(s) based on research questions, timelines and resources<br>• * Own the research process, including designing, recruiting, and conducting usability studies and driving other research activities by leveraging internal teams and external resources<br>• * Perform quick but thorough data analysis by documenting research findings and presenting actionable insights and opportunities to stakeholders in clear, concise, and compelling ways<br>• * Drive impact to the business and customer experience, as measured by changes to the design and development roadmap<br>• * Eagerness to continually learn, grow and improve the craft of UX research<br>• Basic<br>Qualifications:• * 5+ years of hands-on experience with: lab-based user testing, remote testing, paper prototype testing, iterative prototype testing, concept testing, field research, and survey design * BA/BS in experimental psychology, cognitive science, human computer interaction or related discipline<br>• Preferred  * MA/MS in experimental psychology, human computer interaction, anthropology, or related discipline * E-commerce user research experience<br>• * Experience with Google Analytics and Clickstream data reporting tools * Strong command of quantitative, behavioral analysis and statistics<br>• * End-to-end experience with all aspects of research (study design, recruiting, moderation, analysis, reporting) * Working knowledge of behavioral statistics and the principles of experimental design<br>• * A strong portfolio demonstrating past work experience and deliverables (including study plans, usability study reports, user research presentations)<br>• * The ability to extract actionable insights from both qualitative data and quantitative research Quidsi, an Amazon subsidiary, is an Equal Opportunity-Affirmative Action Employer - Minority / Female / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation Posted Date: 6/27/2016</p>
