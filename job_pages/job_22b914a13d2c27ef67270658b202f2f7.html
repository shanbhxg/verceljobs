We’re solving mission-critical challenges faced by developers who require innovative database technology to support their applications. Our solution is built on Mongo DB, the leading No SQL database which is disrupting the multi-billion dollar database market. We're headquartered in the Mission/ Potrero area of San Francisco and are well-funded by premier venture and angel investors including Foundry Group, Baseline Ventures, Upfront Ventures, Freestyle Capital, and David Cohen of Tech Stars. Our users love our Database-as-a-Service (DBaa S) solution, because it allows them to focus their attention on product development, instead of operations. Developers create thousands of new databases per month using our fully managed cloud database service which offers highly available Mongo DB databases on the most popular cloud providers. Our customers love our top-tier support, automated backups, web-based management, performance enhancement tools, and 24/7 monitoring. Looking forward, our roadmap includes a suite of new capabilities which will have a massive impact on the efficiency with which developers write and deploy applications. We’re biased (of course), but we believe our culture is one of our greatest assets. What makes us happiest? Innovating, automating, helping software developers, and giving back to our community.
